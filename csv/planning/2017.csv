0,Proactive and Reactive Coordination of Non-dedicated Agent Teams Operating in Uncertain Environments,Main,"['Markov Decisions Processes', 'Planning under Uncertainty']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/5,"Domains such as disaster rescue, security patrolling etc. often feature dynamic environments where allocations of tasks to agents become ineffective due to unforeseen conditions that may require agents to leave the team. Agents leave the team either due to arrival of high priority tasks (e.g., emergency, accident or violation) or due to some damage to the agent. Existing research in task allocation has only considered fixed number of agents and in some instances arrival of new agents on the team. However, there is little or no literature that considers situations where agents leave the team after task allocation. To that end, we first provide a general model to represent non-dedicated teams. Second, we provide a proactive approach based on sample average approximation to generate a strategy that works well across different feasible scenarios of agents leaving the team. Furthermore, we also provide a 2-stage approach that provides a 2-stage policy that changes allocation based on observed state of the team.  Third, we provide a reactive approach that rearranges the allocated tasks to better adapt to leaving agents. Finally, we provide a detailed evaluation of our approaches on existing benchmark problems."
1,Plan Explanations as Model Reconciliation: Moving Beyond Explanation as Soliloquy,Main,['Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/23,"When AI systems interact with humans in the loop, they are often called on to provide explanations for their plans and behavior. Past work on plan explanations primarily involved the AI system explaining the correctness of its plan and the rationale for its decision in terms of its own model. Such soliloquy is wholly inadequate in most realistic scenarios where the humans have domain and task models that differ significantly from that used by the AI system. We posit that the explanations are best studied in light of these differing models. In particular, we show how explanation can be seen as a ""model reconciliation problem"" (MRP), where the AI system in effect suggests changes to the human's model, so as to make its plan be optimal with respect to that changed human model. We will study the properties of such explanations, present algorithms for automatically computing them, and evaluate the performance of the algorithms."
2,Online Roommate Allocation Problem,Main,['Planning under Uncertainty'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/34,"We study the online allocation problem under a roommate market model introduced in [Chan et al., 2016]. Consider a fixed supply of n rooms and a list of 2n applicants arriving sequentially in an online fashion. The problem is to assign a room to each person upon her arrival, such that after the algorithm terminates, each room is shared by exactly two people. We focus on two objectives: (1) maximizing the social welfare, which is defined as the sum of valuations that applicants have for their rooms, plus the happiness value between each pair of roommates; (2) the allocation should satisfy certain stability conditions, such that no group of people would be willing to switch roommates or rooms. We first show a polynomial-time online algorithm that achieves constant competitive ratio for social welfare maximization. We then extend it to the case where each room is assigned to c > 2 people, and achieve a competitive ratio of Ω(1/c^2). Finally, we show both positive and negative results in satisfying different stability conditions in this online setting."
3,Multi-Agent Planning with Baseline Regret Minimization,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Distributed/Multi-agent Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/63,"We propose a novel baseline regret minimization algorithm for multi-agent planning problems modeled as finite-horizon decentralized POMDPs. It guarantees to produce a policy that is provably better than or at least equivalent to the baseline policy. We also propose an iterative belief generation algorithm to effectively and efficiently minimize the baseline regret, which only requires necessary iterations to converge to the policy with minimum baseline regret. Experimental results on common benchmark problems confirm its advantage comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches."
4,Agent Design Consistency Checking via Planning,Main,['Applications of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/65,"In this work we present a novel approach to check the consistency of agent designs (prior to any implementation) with respect to the requirements specifications via automated planning. This checking is essentially a search problem which makes planning technology an appropriate solution. We focus our work on BDI agent systems and the Prometheus design methodology in order to directly compare our approach to previous work. Our experiments in more than 16K random instances prove that the approach is more effective than previous ones proposed: it achieves higher coverage, lower run-time, and importantly, can handle loops in the agent detailed design and unbounded subgoal reasoning."
5,An Admissible HTN Planning Heuristic,Main,"['Hierarchical planning', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/68,"Hierarchical task network (HTN) planning is well-known for being an efficient planning approach. This is mainly due to the success of the HTN planning system SHOP2. However, its performance depends on hand-designed search control knowledge. At the time being, there are only very few domain-independent heuristics, which are designed for differing hierarchical planning formalisms. Here, we propose an admissible heuristic for standard HTN planning, which allows to find optimal solutions heuristically. It bases upon the so-called task decomposition graph (TDG), a data structure reflecting reachable parts of the task hierarchy. We show (both in theory and empirically) that rebuilding it during planning can improve heuristic accuracy thereby decreasing the explored search space. The evaluation further studies the heuristic both in terms of plan quality and coverage."
6,Online Bridged Pruning for Real-Time Search with Arbitrary Lookaheads,Main,['Real-time Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/72,"Real-time search algorithms are relevant to time-sensitive decision-making domains such as video games and robotics. In such settings, the agent is required to decide on each action under a constant time bound, regardless of the search space size. Despite recent progress, poor-quality solutions can be produced mainly due to state re-visitation. Different techniques have been developed to reduce such a re-visitation with state pruning showing promise. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach applicable to the wide class of real-time search algorithms. Given a local search space of arbitrary size, our technique aggressively prunes away all states in its interior, possibly adding new edges to maintain the connectivity of the search space frontier. An experimental evaluation shows that our pruning often improves the performance of a base real-time search algorithm by over an order of magnitude.  This allows our implemented system to outperform state-of-the-art real-time search algorithms used in the evaluation."
7,Compact MDDs for Pseudo-Boolean Constraints with At-Most-One Relations in Resource-Constrained Scheduling Problems,Main,['Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/78,"Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints are usually encoded into Boolean clauses using compact Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) representations. Although these constraints appear in many problems, they are particularly useful for representing resource constraints in scheduling problems. Sometimes, the Boolean variables in the PB constraints have implicit at-most-one relations. In this work we introduce a way to take advantage of these implicit relations to obtain a compact Multi-Decision Diagram (MDD) representation for those PB constraints. We provide empirical evidence of the usefulness of this technique for some Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) variants, namely the Multi-Mode RCPSP (MRCPSP) and the RCPSP with Time-Dependent Resource Capacities and Requests (RCPSP/t). The size reduction of the representation of the PB constraints lets us decrease the number of Boolean variables in the encodings by one order of magnitude. We close/certify the optimum of many instances of these problems."
8,Relaxed Exists-Step Plans in Planning as SMT,Main,"['Temporal and Hybrid planning', 'Other approaches to planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/79,"Planning Modulo Theories (PMT), inspired by Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), allows the integration of arbitrary first order theories, such as linear arithmetic, with propositional planning. Under this setting, planning as SAT is generalized to planning as SMT. In this paper we introduce a new encoding for planning as SMT, which adheres to the relaxed relaxed ∃-step (R 2 ∃-step) semantics for parallel plans. We show the benefits of relaxing the requirements on the set of actions eligible to be executed at the same time, even though many redundant actions can be introduced. We also show how, by a MaxSMT based post-processing step, redundant actions can be efficiently removed, and provide experimental results showing the benefits of this approach."
9,Personnel Scheduling as Satisfiability Modulo Theories,Main,['Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/86,"Rotating workforce scheduling (RWS) is an important real-life personnel rostering problem that appears in a large number of different business areas. In this paper, we propose a new exact approach to RWS that exploits the recent advances on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). While solving can be automated by using a number of so-called SMT-solvers, the most challenging task is to find an efficient formulation of the problem in first-order logic. We propose two new modeling techniques for RWS that encode the problem using formulas over different background theories. The first encoding provides an elegant approach based on linear integer arithmetic. Furthermore, we developed a new formulation based on bitvectors in order to achieve a more compact representation of the constraints and a reduced number of variables. These two modeling approaches were experimentally evaluated on benchmark instances from literature using different state-of-the-art SMT-solvers. Compared to other exact methods, the results of this approach showed an important improvement in the number of found solutions."
10,Temporal Planning with Clock-Based SMT Encodings,Main,"['Temporal and Hybrid planning', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/103,"We propose more scalable encodings of temporal planning in SMT. The first contribution is practical clock-based encodings of resources and effect delays. Existing encodings of effect delays (Shin and Davis, 2015) have a quadratic size, due to the necessity to determine the time differences between steps for a linear number of steps. Clocks improve this to linear. The second contribution is a new relaxed scheme for steps. Existing schemes require a step for every time point with discontinuous change. This is relaxed, improving scalability."
11,Nonlinear Hybrid Planning with Deep Net Learned Transition Models and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,Main,['Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/104,"In many real-world hybrid (mixed discrete continuous) planning problems such as Reservoir Control, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Navigation, it is difficult to obtain a model of the complex nonlinear dynamics that govern state evolution.  However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allow us to collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep network models of their state transitions.  But there remains one major problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we make the critical observation that the popular Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transfer function for deep networks not only allows accurate nonlinear deep net model learning, but also permits a direct compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) encoding in a planner we call Hybrid Deep MILP Planning (HD-MILP-PLAN). We identify deep net specific optimizations and a simple sparsification method for HD-MILP-PLAN that improve performance over a naive encoding, and show that we are able to plan optimally with respect to the learned deep network."
12,Generalized Planning: Non-Deterministic Abstractions and Trajectory Constraints,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/121,"We study the characterization and computation of general policies for families of problems that share a  structure characterized by a common reduction into a single abstract problem. Policies mu that solve the abstract problem P have been shown to solve all problems Q that reduce to P provided that mu terminates in Q. In this work, we shed light on  why this termination condition is needed  and how it can be removed. The key observation is that the abstract problem P captures the common  structure among the concrete problems Q that is local (Markovian) but misses common structure that is global. We show how such global structure can be captured by means of trajectory constraints that in many cases can be expressed  as LTL formulas, thus reducing  generalized planning to LTL synthesis.  Moreover, for a broad class of problems that involve integer variables that can be increased or decreased, trajectory constraints can be compiled away, reducing generalized planning to fully observable non-deterministic planning."
13,Bounded Timed Propositional Temporal Logic with Past Captures Timeline-based Planning with Bounded Constraints,Main,"['Planning and Scheduling', 'Theoretical Foundations of Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/140,"Within the timeline-based framework, planning problems are modeled as sets of independent, but interacting, components whose behavior over time is described by a set of temporal constraints. Timeline-based planning is being used successfully in a number of complex tasks, but its theoretical properties are not so well studied. In particular, while it is known that Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) can capture classical action-based planning, a similar logical characterization was not available for timeline-based planning formalisms. This paper shows that timeline-based planning with bounded temporal constraints can be captured by a bounded version of Timed Propositional Temporal Logic, augmented with past operators, which is an extension of LTL originally designed for the verification of real-time systems. As a byproduct, we get that the proposed logic is expressive enough to capture temporal action-based planning problems."
14,Strategically knowing how,Main,['Planning under Uncertainty'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/143,"In this paper, we propose a single-agent logic of goal-directed knowing how extending the standard epistemic logic of knowing that with a new knowing how operator. The semantics of the new operator is based on the idea that knowing how to achieve phi means that there exists a (uniform) strategy such that the agent knows that it can make sure phi. We give an intuitive axiomatisation of our logic and prove the soundness, completeness, and decidability of the logic. The crucial axioms relating knowing that and knowing how illustrate our understanding of knowing how in this setting. This logic can be used in representing and reasoning about knowledge-how."
15,A General Multi-agent Epistemic Planner Based on Higher-order Belief Change,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/152,"In recent years, multi-agent epistemic planning has received attention from both dynamic logic and planning communities. Existing implementations of multi-agent epistemic planning are based on compilation into classical planning and suffer from various limitations, such as generating only linear plans, restriction to public actions, and incapability to handle disjunctive beliefs. In this paper, we propose a general representation language for multi-agent epistemic planning where the initial KB and the goal, the preconditions and effects of actions can be arbitrary multi-agent epistemic formulas, and the solution is an action tree branching on sensing results.To support efficient reasoning in the multi-agent KD45 logic, we make use of a normal form called alternative cover disjunctive formula (ACDF). We propose basic revision and update algorithms for ACDF formulas. We also handle static propositional common knowledge, which we call constraints. Based on our reasoning, revision and update algorithms, adapting the PrAO algorithm for contingent planning from the literature, we implemented a multi-agent epistemic planner called MAEP. Our experimental results show the viability of our approach."
16,Temporalising Separation Logic for Planning with Search Control Knowledge,Main,['Other approaches to planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/162,"Temporal logics are widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning for specifying Search Control Knowledge (SCK). However, traditional temporal logics are limited in expressive power since they are unable to express spatial constraints which are as important as temporal ones in many planning domains. To this end, we propose a two-dimensional (spatial and temporal) logic namely PPTL^SL by temporalising separation logic with Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL). The new logic is well-suited for specifying SCK containing both spatial and temporal constraints which are useful in AI planning. We show that PPTL^SL is decidable and present a decision procedure. With this basis, a planner namely S-TSolver for computing plans based on the spatio-temporal SCK expressed in PPTL^SL formulas is developed. Evaluation on some selected benchmark domains shows the effectiveness of S-TSolver."
17,Generalized Target Assignment and Path Finding Using Answer Set Programming,Main,['Applications of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/169,"In Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), a team of agents needs to find collision-free paths from their starting locations to their respective targets. Combined Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) extends MAPF by including the problem of assigning targets to agents as a precursor to the MAPF problem. A limitation of both models is their assumption that the number of agents and targets are equal, which is invalid in some applications such as autonomous warehouse systems. We address this limitation by generalizing TAPF to allow for (1)~unequal number of agents and tasks; (2)~tasks to have deadlines by which they must be completed; (3)~ordering of groups of tasks to be completed; and (4)~tasks that are composed of a sequence of checkpoints that must be visited in a specific order. Further, we model the problem using answer set programming (ASP) to show that customizing the desired variant of the problem is simple one only needs to choose the appropriate combination of ASP rules to enforce it. We also demonstrate experimentally that if problem specific information can be incorporated into the ASP encoding then ASP based method can be efficient and can scale up to solve practical applications."
18,Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchies of Machines by Leveraging Internal Transitions,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/196,"In the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, the idea of hierarchies of abstract machines (HAMs) is to write a partial policy as a set of hierarchical finite state machines with unspecified choice states, and use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal completion of this partial policy. Given a HAM with potentially deep hierarchical structure, there often exist many internal transitions where a machine calls another machine with the environment state unchanged. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that discovers such internal transitions automatically, and shortcircuits them recursively in computation of Q values. The resulting HAMQ-INT algorithm outperforms the state of the art significantly on the benchmark Taxi domain and a much more complex RoboCup Keepaway domain."
19,Improved Strong Worst-case Upper Bounds for MDP Planning,Main,"['Markov Decisions Processes', 'Planning Algorithms']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/248,"The Markov Decision Problem (MDP) plays a central role in AI as an abstraction of sequential decision making. We contribute to the theoretical analysis of MDP PLANNING, which is the problem of computing an optimal policy for a given MDP. Specifically, we furnish improved STRONG WORST-CASE upper bounds on the running time of MDP planning. Strong bounds are those that depend only on the number of states n and the number of actions k in the specified MDP; they have no dependence on affiliated variables such as the discount factor and the number of bits needed to represent the MDP. Worst-case bounds apply to EVERY run of an algorithm; randomised algorithms can typically yield faster EXPECTED running times. While the special case of 2-action MDPs (that is, k = 2) has recently received some attention, bounds for general k have remained to be improved for several decades. Our contributions are to this general case. For k >= 3, the tightest strong upper bound shown to date for MDP planning belongs to a family of algorithms called Policy Iteration. This bound is only a polynomial improvement over a trivial bound of poly(n, k) k^{n} [Mansour and Singh, 1999]. In this paper, we generalise a contrasting algorithm called the Fibonacci Seesaw, and derive a bound of poly(n, k) k^{0.6834n}. The key construct we use is a template to map algorithms for the 2-action setting to the general setting. Interestingly, this idea can also be used to design Policy Iteration algorithms with a running time upper bound of poly(n, k) k^{0.7207n}. Both our results improve upon bounds that have stood for several decades."
20,Decreasing Uncertainty in Planning with State Prediction,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Robot Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/282,"In real world environments the state is almost never completely known. Exploration is often expensive. The application of planning in these environments is consequently more difficult and less robust. In this paper we present an approach for predicting new information about a partially-known state. The state is translated into a partially-known multigraph, which can then be extended using machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it enhances the scalability of our planners, and leads to less time spent on sensing actions."
21,Constrained Bayesian Reinforcement Learning via Approximate Linear Programming,Main,['POMDPs'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/290,"In this paper, we consider the safe learning scenario where we need to restrict the exploratory behavior of a reinforcement learning agent. Specifically, we treat the problem as a form of Bayesian reinforcement learning in an environment that is modeled as a constrained MDP (CMDP) where the cost function penalizes undesirable situations. We propose a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) algorithm for such an environment, eliciting risk-sensitive exploration in a principled way. Our algorithm efficiently solves the constrained BRL problem by approximate linear programming, and generates a finite state controller in an off-line manner. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically that our approach outperforms the state of the art."
22,Count-Based Exploration in Feature Space for Reinforcement Learning,Main,['Planning under Uncertainty'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/344,"We introduce a new count-based optimistic exploration algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL) that is feasible in environments with high-dimensional state-action spaces. The success of RL algorithms in these domains depends crucially on generalisation from limited training experience. Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalise in order to estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods enable generalisation regarding uncertainty. This has prevented the combination of scalable RL algorithms with efficient exploration strategies that drive the agent to reduce its uncertainty. We present a new method for computing a generalised state visit-count, which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated with any state. Our \phi-pseudocount achieves generalisation by exploiting same feature representation of the state space that is used for value function approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed more uncertain. The \phi-Exploration-Bonus algorithm rewards the agent for exploring in feature space rather than in the untransformed state space. The method is simpler and less computationally expensive than some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art results on high-dimensional RL benchmarks."
23,Logistic Markov Decision Processes,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/346,"User modeling in advertising and recommendation has typically focused on myopic predictors of user responses. In this work, we consider the long-term decision problem associated with user interaction. We propose a concise specification of long-term interaction dynamics by combining factored dynamic Bayesian networks with logistic predictors of user responses, allowing state-of-the-art prediction models to be seamlessly extended. We show how to solve such models at scale by providing a constraint generation approach for approximate linear programming that overcomes the variable coupling and non-linearity induced by the logistic regression predictor. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on advertising domains with up to 2^54 states and 2^39 actions."
24,Learning from Demonstrations with High-Level Side Information,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/426,"We consider the problem of learning from demonstration, where extra side information about the demonstration is encoded as a co-safe linear temporal logic formula. We address two known limitations of existing methods that do not account for such side information. First, the policies that result from existing methods, while matching the expected features or likelihood of the demonstrations, may still be in conflict with high-level objectives not explicit in the demonstration trajectories. Second, existing methods fail to provide a priori guarantees on the out-of-sample generalization performance with respect to such high-level goals. This lack of formal guarantees can prevent the application of learning from demonstration to safety- critical systems, especially when inference to state space regions with poor demonstration coverage is required. In this work, we show that side information, when explicitly taken into account, indeed improves the performance and safety of the learned policy with respect to task implementation. Moreover, we describe an automated procedure to systematically generate the features that encode side information expressed in temporal logic."
25,Stratified Strategy Selection for Unit Control in Real-Time Strategy Games,Main,['Real-time Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/522,"In this paper we introduce Stratified Strategy Selection (SSS), a novel search algorithm for micromanaging units in real-time strategy (RTS) games. SSS uses a type system to partition the player's units into types and assumes that units of the same type must follow the same strategy. SSS searches in the state space induced by the type system to select, from a pool of options, a strategy for each unit. Empirical results on a simulator of an RTS game shows that SSS employing either fixed or adaptive type systems is able to substantially outperform state-of-the-art search-based algorithms in combat scenarios with up to 100 units."
26,No Time to Observe: Adaptive Influence Maximization with Partial Feedback,Main,['Planning with Incomplete information'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/546,"Although influence maximization problem has been extensively studied over the past ten years, majority of existing work adopt one of the following models: full-feedback model or zero-feedback model. In the zero-feedback model, we have to commit the seed users all at once in advance, this strategy is also known as non-adaptive policy. In the full-feedback model, we select one seed at a time and wait until the diffusion completes, before selecting the next seed. Full-feedback model has better performance but potentially huge delay, zero-feedback model has zero delay but poorer performance since it does not utilize the observation that may be made during the seeding process. To fill the gap between these two models, we propose partial-feedback model, which allows us to select a seed at any intermediate stage. We develop a novel alpha-greedy policy that achieves a bounded approximation ratio."
27,Efficient Optimal Search under Expensive Edge Cost Computation,Main,['Search in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/596,"Optimal heuristic search has been successful in many domains, including journey planning, route planning and puzzle solving. Existing work typically assumes that the cost of each action can easily be obtained. However, in many problems, the exact edge cost is expensive to compute. Existing search algorithms face a significant performance bottleneck, due to an excessive overhead associated with dynamically calculating exact edge costs. We present DEA*, an algorithm for problems with expensive edge cost computations. DEA* combines heuristic edge cost evaluations with delayed node expansions, reducing the number of exact edge computations. We formally prove that DEA* is optimal and it is efficient with respect to the number of exact edge cost computations. We empirically evaluate DEA* on multiple-worker routing problems where the exact edge cost is calculated by invoking an external multi-modal journey planning engine. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas in reducing the computational time and improving the solving ability. In addition, we show the advantages of DEA* in domain-independent planning, where we simulate that accurate edge costs are expensive to compute."
28,Reduction Techniques for Model Checking and Learning in MDPs,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/597,"Omega-regular objectives in Markov decision processes (MDPs) reduce to reachability: find a policy which maximizes the probability of reaching a target set of states. Given an MDP, an initial distribution, and a target set of states, such a policy can be computed by most probabilistic model checking tools. If the MDP is only partially specified, i.e., some prob- abilities are unknown, then model-learning techniques can be used to statistically approximate the probabilities and enable the computation of the de- sired policy. For fully specified MDPs, reducing the size of the MDP translates into faster model checking; for partially specified MDPs, into faster learning. We provide reduction techniques that al- low us to remove irrelevant transition probabilities: transition probabilities (known, or to be learned) that do not influence the maximal reachability probability. Among other applications, these reductions can be seen as a pre-processing of MDPs before model checking or as a way to reduce the number of experiments required to obtain a good approximation of an unknown MDP."
29,Faster Conflict Generation for Dynamic Controllability,Main,"['Scheduling', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/598,"In this paper, we focus on speeding up the temporal plan relaxation problem for dynamically controllable systems. We take a look at the current best-known algorithm for determining dynamic controllability and augment it to efficiently generate conflicts when the network is deemed uncontrollable. Our work preserves the O(n^3) runtime of the best available dynamic controllability checker and improves on the previous best runtime of O(n^4) for extracting dynamic controllability conflicts. We then turn our attention to temporal plan relaxation tasks and show how we can leverage our work on conflicts and the structure of the network to efficiently make incremental updates intended to restore dynamic controllability by relaxing constraints. Our new algorithm, RelaxIDC, has the same asymptotic runtime as previous algorithms but sees dramatic empirical improvements over the course of repeated dynamic controllability checks."
30,Additive Merge-and-Shrink Heuristics for Diverse Action Costs,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/599,"In many planning applications, actions can have highly diverse costs. Recent studies focus on the effects of diverse action costs on search algorithms, but not on their effects on domain-independent heuristics. In this paper, we demonstrate there are negative impacts of action cost diversity on merge-and-shrink (M&S), a successful abstraction method for producing high-quality heuristics for planning problems. We propose a new cost partitioning method for M&S to address the negative effects of diverse action costs. We investigate non-unit cost IPC domains, especially those for which diverse action costs have severe negative effects on the quality of the M&S heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that in these domains, an additive set of M&S heuristics using the new cost partitioning method produces much more informative and effective heuristics than creating a single M&S heuristic which directly encodes diverse costs."
31,Purely Declarative Action Descriptions are Overrated: Classical Planning with Simulators,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/600,"Classical planning is concerned with problems where a goal needs to be reached from a known initial state by doing actions with deterministic, known effects. Classical planners, however, deal only with classical problems that can be expressed in declarative planning languages such as STRIPS or PDDL. This prevents their use on problems that are not easy to model declaratively or whose dynamics are given via simulations. Simulators do not provide a declarative representation of actions, but simply return successor states. The question we address in this paper is: can a planner that has access to the structure of states and goals only, approach the performance of planners that also have access to the structure of actions expressed in PDDL? To answer this, we develop domain-independent, black box planning algorithms that completely ignore action structure, and show that they match the performance of state-of-the-art classical planners on the standard planning benchmarks. Effective black box algorithms open up new possibilities for modeling and for expressing control knowledge, which we also illustrate."
32,On Creating Complementary Pattern Databases,Main,['Planning Algorithms'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/601,"A pattern database (PDB) for a planning task is a heuristic function in the form of a lookup table that contains optimal solution costs of a simplified version of the task. In this paper we introduce a method that sequentially creates multiple PDBs which are later combined into a single heuristic function.  At a given iteration, our method uses estimates of the A* running time to create a PDB that complements the strengths of the PDBs created in previous iterations. We evaluate our algorithm using explicit and symbolic PDBs. Our results show that the heuristics produced by our approach are able to outperform existing schemes, and that our method is able to create PDBs that complement the strengths of other existing heuristics such as a symbolic perimeter heuristic."
33,Beyond Forks: Finding and Ranking Star Factorings for Decoupled Search,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling', 'Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/602,"Star-topology decoupling is a recent search reduction method for forward state space search. The idea basically is to automatically identify a star factoring, then search only over the center component in the star, avoiding interleavings across leaf components. The framework can handle complex star topologies, yet prior work on decoupled search considered only factoring strategies identifying fork and inverted-fork topologies. Here, we introduce factoring strategies able to detect general star topologies, thereby extending the reach of decoupled search to new factorings and to new domains, sometimes resulting in significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we introduce a predictive portfolio method that reliably selects the most suitable factoring for a given planning task, leading to superior overall performance."
34,Intelligent Belief State Sampling for Conformant Planning,Main,['Conformant/Contingent planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/603,"We propose a new method for conformant planning based on two ideas.  First given a small sample of the initial belief state  we reduce conformant planning for this sample  to a classical planning problem, giving us a candidate solution.  Second we exploit regression as a way to compactly represent  necessary conditions for such a solution  to be valid for the non-deterministic setting.   If necessary, we use the resulting formula  to extract a counter-example to populate our next sampling.  Our experiments show that this approach  is competitive on a class of problems  that are hard for traditional planners,   and also returns generally shorter plans.  We are also able to demonstrate unsatisfiability of some problems."
35,Softpressure: A Schedule-Driven Backpressure Algorithm for Coping with Network Congestion,Main,"['Scheduling', 'Real-time Planning', 'Applications of Planning', 'Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/604,"We consider the problem of minimizing the the delay of jobs moving through a directed graph of service nodes.  In this problem, each node may have several links and is constrained to serve one link at a time.  As jobs move through the network, they can pass through a node only after they have been serviced by that node. The objective is to minimize the delay jobs incur sitting on queues waiting to be serviced.  Two popular approaches to this problem are backpressure algorithm and schedule-driven control.  In this paper, we present a hybrid approach of those two methods that incorporates the stability of queuing theory into the schedule-driven control.  We then demonstrate how this hybrid method outperforms the other two in a real-time traffic signal control problem, where the nodes are traffic lights, the links are roads, and the jobs are vehicles.  We show through simulations that, in scenarios with heavy congestion, the hybrid method results in 50% and 15% reductions in delay over schedule-driven control and backpressure respectively. A theoretical analysis also justifies our results."

The intrinsic high complexity of switched linear dynamical robots makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel HMPC based method to address the navigation problem of multiple robots with switched linear dynamics. We develop a new technique to compute the reachable sets of switched linear systems and use them to enable the parallel computation of control parameters. We present theoretical results on stability, feasibility and complexity of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its empirical advance in performance against other approaches."

However, these fluents are not directly supported by most planners and heuristics. We describe a family of planning algorithms that takes a numeric planning problem and produces an abstracted representation that can be solved using any classical planner. The resulting abstract plan is generalized into a policy and then used to guide the search in the original numeric domain. We prove that our approach is sound, and we evaluate it on a set of standard benchmarks. We show that it can provide competitive performance when compared to other well-known algorithms for numeric planning, and a significant performance improvement in certain domains."
38,Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian Policy Search for POMDPs,Main,['POMDPs'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/607,"This paper proposes a novel direct policy search (DPS) method with model selection for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). DPSs have been standard for learning POMDPs due to their computational efficiency and natural ability to maximize total rewards. An important open challenge for the best use of DPS methods is model selection, i.e., determination of the proper dimensionality of hidden states and complexity of policy functions, to mitigate overfitting in highly-flexible model representations of POMDPs. This paper bridges Bayesian inference and reward maximization and derives marginalized weighted log-likelihood~(MWL) for POMDPs which takes both advantages of Bayesian model selection and DPS. Then we propose factorized asymptotic Bayesian policy search (FABPS) to explore the model and the policy which maximizes MWL by expanding recently-developed factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference. Experimental results show that FABPS outperforms state-of-the-art model selection methods for POMDPs, with respect both to model selection and to expected total rewards."

ER-UMD fits well contemporary applications that require offline design of environments where robots and humans act and cooperate. To find an optimal modification sequence we present two novel solution techniques: a compilation that embeds design into a planning problem, allowing use of off-the-shelf solvers to find a solution, and a heuristic search in the modifications space, for which we present an admissible heuristic. Evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach using standard benchmarks from the probabilistic planning competition and a benchmark we created for a vacuum cleaning robot setting."
40,Integrating Answer Set Programming with Semantic Dictionaries for Robot Task Planning,Main,"['Planning with Incomplete information', 'Robot Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/609,"In this paper, we propose a novel integrated task planning system for service robot in domestic domains. Given open-ended high-level user instructions in natural language, robots need to generate a plan, i.e., a sequence of low-level executable actions, to complete the required tasks. To address this, we exploit the knowledge on semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries such as FrameNet and integrate it with Answer Set Programming --- a task planning framework with both representation language and solvers. In the experiments, we evaluated our approach using common benchmarks on service tasks and showed that it can successfully handle much more tasks than the state-of-the-art solution. Notably, we deployed the proposed planning system on our service robot for the annual RoboCup@Home competitions and achieved very encouraging results."

This paper formalises deception as it applies to path-planning and introduces the notion of a last deceptive point (LDP) which, when measured in terms of 'path completion', can be used to rank paths by their potential to deceive. Building on recent developments in probabilistic goal-recognition, we propose a formula to calculate an optimal LDP and present strategies for the generation of deceptive paths by both simulation ('showing the false') and dissimulation ('hiding the real')."
42,Lossy Compression of Pattern Databases Using Acyclic Random Hypergraphs,Main,['Search in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/611,"A domain-independent heuristic function created by an abstraction is usually implemented using a Pattern Database (PDB), which is a lookup table of (abstract state, heuristic value) pairs. PDBs containing high quality heuristic values generally require substantial memory space and therefore need to be compressed. In this paper, we introduce Acyclic Random Hypergraph Compression (ARHC), a domain-independent approach to compressing PDBs using acyclic random r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs. The ARHC algorithm, which comes in Base and Extended versions, provides fast lookup and a high compression rate. ARHC-Extended achieves higher quality heuristics than ARHC-Base by decreasing the heuristic information loss at the cost of some decrease in the compression rate. ARHC shows higher performance than level-by-level Bloom filter PDB compression in all experiments conducted so far."

Intuitively, numeric landmarks are regions in the metric space defined by the problem whose crossing is necessary for its resolution. The paper proposes a relaxation-based method for their automated extraction directly from the problem structure, and shows how to exploit them to infer what we call disjunctive and additive hybrid action landmarks. The justification of such a disjunctive representation results from the intertwined propositional and numeric structure of the problem. The paper exercises their use in two novel admissible LP-Based numeric heuristics, and reports experiments on cost-optimal numeric planning problems. Results show the heuristics are more informed and effective than previous work for problems involving a higher number of (sub)goals."

Our approach is to compile this task into a classical planning problem whose solutions are sequences of actions that build and validate a CFG compliant with the input strings. In addition, we show that our compilation is suitable for implementing the two canonical tasks for CFGs, string production and string recognition."
45,"Search and Learn: On Dead-End Detectors, the Traps they Set, and Trap Learning",Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/614,"A key technique for proving unsolvability in classical planning are dead-end detectors \Delta: effectively testable criteria sufficient for unsolvability, pruning (some) unsolvable states during search. Related to this, a recent proposal is the identification of traps prior to search, compact representations of non-goal state sets T that cannot be escaped. Here, we create new synergy across these ideas. We define a generalized concept of traps, relative to a given dead-end detector \Delta, where T can be escaped, but only into dead-end states detected by \Delta. We show how to learn compact representations of such T during search, extending the reach of \Delta. Our experiments show that this can be quite beneficial. It improves coverage for many unsolvable benchmark planning domains and dead-end detectors \Delta, in particular on resource-constrained domains where it outperforms the state of the art."
46,"Efficient, Safe, and Probably Approximately Complete Learning of Action Models",Main,"['Theoretical Foundations of Planning', 'Planning with Incomplete information', 'Conformant/Contingent planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/615,"In this paper we explore the theoretical boundaries of planning in a setting where no model of the agent's actions is given. Instead of an action model, a set of successfully executed plans are given and the task is to generate a plan that is safe, i.e., guaranteed to achieve the goal without failing.  To this end, we show how to learn a conservative model of the world  in which actions are guaranteed to be applicable.  This conservative model is then given to an off-the-shelf classical planner,  resulting in a plan that is guaranteed to achieve the goal.  However, this reduction from a model-free planning to a  model-based planning is not complete: in some cases  a plan will not be found even when such exists.  We analyze the relation between the number of observed plans  and the likelihood that our conservative approach will indeed fail to solve a solvable problem. Our analysis show that the number of trajectories needed scales gracefully."
47,An Improved Approximation Algorithm for the Subpath Planning Problem and Its Generalization,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/616,"This paper focuses on a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the subpath planning problem (SPP). Given 2n vertices and n independent edges on a metric space, we aim to find a shortest tour that contains all the edges. SPP is one of the fundamental problems in both artificial intelligence and robotics. Our main result is to design a 1.5-approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time, improving the currently best approximation algorithm. The idea is direct use of techniques developed for TSP. In addition, we propose a generalization of SPP called the subgroup planning problem (SGPP). In this problem, we are given a set of disjoint groups of vertices, and we aim to find a shortest tour such that all the vertices in each group are traversed sequentially. We propose a 3-approximation algorithm for SGPP. We also conduct numerical experiments. Compared with previous algorithms, our algorithms improve the solution quality by more than 10% for large instances with more than 10,000 vertices."
48,Robust Advertisement Allocation,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Planning under Uncertainty']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/617,"With the rapid growth of e-commerce and World Wide Web, internet advertising revenue has surpassed broadcast revenue very recently. As online advertising has become a major source of revenue for online publishers, such as Google and Amazon, one problem facing them is to optimize the ads selection and allocation in order to maximize their revenue.  Although there is a rich body of work that has been devoted to this field, uncertainty about models and parameter settings is largely ignored in existing algorithm design.  To fill this gap, we are the first to formulate and study the \emph{Robust Ad Allocation} problem, by taking into account the uncertainty about parameter settings. We define a Robust Ad Allocation framework with a set of candidate parameter settings, typically derived from different users or topics. Our main aim is to develop robust ad allocation algorithms, which can provide satisfactory performance across a spectrum of parameter settings,  compared to the (parameter-specific) optimum solutions. We study this problem progressively and propose a series of algorithms with bounded approximation ratio."
49,From Qualitative to Quantitative Dominance Pruning for Optimal Planning,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/618,"Dominance relations compare states to determine whether one is at least as good as another in terms of their goal distance. We generalize these qualitative yes/no relations to functions that measure by how much a state is better than another. This allows us to distinguish cases where the state is strictly closer to the goal. Moreover, we may obtain a bound on the difference in goal distance between two states even if there is no qualitative dominance.We analyze the multiple advantages that quantitative dominance has, like discovering coarser dominance relations, or trading dominance by g-value. Moreover, quantitative dominance can also be used to prove that an action starts an optimal plan from a given state. We introduce a novel action selection pruning that uses this to prune any other successor. Results show that quantitative dominance pruning greatly reduces the search space, significantly increasing the planners' performance."
50,Mechanism Design for Strategic Project Scheduling,Main,['Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/619,"Organizing large scale projects (e.g., Conferences, IT Shows, F1 race) requires precise scheduling of multiple dependent tasks on common resources where multiple selfish entities are competing to execute the individual tasks. In this paper, we consider a well studied and rich scheduling model referred to as RCPSP (Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem). The key change to this model that we consider in this paper is the presence of selfish entities competing to perform individual tasks with the aim of maximizing their own utility. Due to the selfish entities in play, the goal of the scheduling problem is no longer only to minimize makespan for the entire project, but rather, to maximize social welfare while ensuring incentive compatibility and economic efficiency. We show that traditional VCG mechanism is not  incentive compatible  in this context and hence we provide two new practical mechanisms that extend on VCG. These new mechanisms referred to as Individual Completion based Payments (ICP) and Social Completion based Payments (SCP) provide strong theoretical properties including strategy proofness."

While our approach is general, we focus our initial experiments on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits that have few ordering constraints and thus allow highly parallel plans. We report on experiments using several temporal planners to compile circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. This early empirical evaluation suggests that temporal planning is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation."
52,Heuristic Online Goal Recognition in Continuous Domains,Main,"['Activity and Plan Recognition', 'Robot Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/621,"Goal recognition is the problem of inferring the goal of an agent, based on its observed actions. An inspiring approach—plan recognition by planning (PRP)—uses off-the-shelf planners to dynamically generate plans for given goals, eliminating the need for the traditional plan library. However, existing PRP formulation is inherently inefficient in online recognition, and cannot be used with motion planners for continuous spaces. In this paper, we utilize a different PRP formulation which allows for online goal recognition, and for application in continuous spaces. We present an online recognition algorithm, where two heuristic decision points may be used to improve run-time significantly over existing work. We specify heuristics for continuous domains, prove guarantees on their use, and empirically evaluate the algorithm over hundreds of experiments in both a 3D navigational environment and a cooperative robotic team task."
53,New Metrics and Algorithms for Stochastic Goal Recognition Design Problems,Main,"['Activity and Plan Recognition', 'Markov Decisions Processes']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/622,"Goal Recognition Design (GRD) problems involve identifying the best ways to modify the underlying environment that agents operate in, typically by making a subset of feasible actions infeasible, in such a way that agents are forced to reveal their goals as early as possible. The Stochastic GRD (S-GRD) model is an important extension that introduced stochasticity to the outcome of agent actions. Unfortunately, the worst-case distinctiveness (wcd) metric proposed for S-GRDs has a formal definition that is inconsistent with its intuitive definition, which is the maximal number of actions an agent can take, in the expectation, before its goal is revealed. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a new wcd metric, called all-goals wcd (wcdag), that remedies this inconsistency; (2) We introduce a new metric, called expected-case distinctiveness (ecd), that weighs the possible goals based on their importance; (3) We provide theoretical results comparing these different metrics as well as the complexity of computing them optimally; and (4) We describe new efficient algorithms to compute the wcdag and ecd values."

We show that just as for TIHTN planning, all solutions of the TIHTNS planning problem can be obtained by acyclic decomposition and task insertion, entailing that its plan-existence problem is decidable without any restriction on decomposition methods. We also prove that the extension by state constraints does not increase the complexity of the plan-existence problem, which stays 2-NEXPTIME-complete, based on an acyclic progression operator. In addition, we show that TIHTNS planning covers not only the original TIHTN planning but also hierarchy-relaxed hierarchical goal network planning."
55,A Scalable Approach to Chasing Multiple Moving Targets with Multiple Agents,Main,['Search in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/624,"Chasing multiple mobile targets with multiple agents is important in several applications, such as computer games and police chasing scenarios. Existing approaches can compute optimal policies. However, they have a limited scalability, as they implement expensive minimax searches. We introduce a sub-optimal but scalable approach that assigns individual agents to individual targets and that can dynamically re-compute such assignments. We provide a theoretical analysis, including upper bounds on the number of time steps required to solve an instance. In a detailed empirical evaluation on grid maps, our algorithm scales up very convincingly beyond the limits of previous methods. On small problems, where a comparison to a minimax approach is possible, the results demonstrate a good solution quality for our method."
56,Bridging the Gap between Observation and Decision Making: Goal Recognition and Flexible Resource Allocation in Dynamic Network Interdiction,Main,['Activity and Plan Recognition'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/625,"Goal recognition, which is the task of inferring an agent’s goals given some or all of the agent’s observed actions, is one of the important approaches in bridging the gap between the observation and decision making within an observe-orient-decide-act cycle. Unfortunately, few researches focus on how to improve the utilization of knowledge produced by a goal recognition system. In this work, we propose a Markov Decision Process-based goal recognition approach tailored to a dynamic shortest-path local network interdiction (DSPLNI) problem. We first introduce a novel DSPLNI model and its solvable dual form so as to incorporate real-time knowledge acquired from goal recognition system. Then a Markov Decision Process-based goal recognition model along with its dynamic Bayesian network representation and the applied goal inference method is proposed to identify the evader’s real goal within the DSPLNI context. Based on that, we further propose an efficient scalable technique in maintaining action utility map used in fast goal inference, and develop a flexible resource assignment mechanism in DSPLNI using knowledge from goal recognition system. Experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of our methods both in goal recognition and dynamic network interdiction."

Unfortunately, current Dec-POMDP solution methods cannot solve problems with continuous observations, which are common in many real-world domains. To that end, we present a framework for representing and generating Dec-POMDP policies that explicitly include continuous observations. We apply our algorithm to a novel tagging problem and an extended version of a common benchmark, where it generates policies that meet or exceed the values of equivalent discretized domains without the need for finding an adequate discretization."
58,Efficient Mechanism Design for Online Scheduling (Extended Abstract),Journal,['Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/707,"This work concerns the mechanism design for online scheduling in a strategic setting. In this setting, each job is owned by a self-interested agent who may misreport the release time, deadline, length, and value of her job, while we need to determine not only the schedule of the jobs, but also the payment of each agent. We focus on the design of incentive compatible (IC) mechanisms, and study the maximization of social welfare (i.e., the aggregated value of completed jobs) by competitive analysis. We first derive two lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any deterministic IC mechanism to characterize the landscape of our research: one bound is 5, which holds for equal-length jobs; the other bound is $\frac{\kappa}{\ln\kappa}+1-o(1)$, which holds for unequal-length jobs, where $\kappa$ is the maximum ratio between lengths of any two jobs. We then propose a deterministic IC mechanism and show that such a simple mechanism works very well for two models: (1) In the preemption-restart model, the mechanism can achieve the optimal competitive ratio of 5 for equal-length jobs and a near optimal ratio of $(\frac{1}{(1-\epsilon)^2}+o(1)) \frac{\kappa}{\ln\kappa}$ for unequal-length jobs, where $0<\epsilon<1$ is a small constant; (2) In the preemption-resume model, the mechanism can achieve the optimal competitive ratio of 5 for equal-length jobs and a near optimal competitive ratio (within factor 2) for unequal-length jobs."
59,A generic approach to planning in the presence of incomplete information: Theory and implementation (Extended Abstract),Journal,"['Planning with Incomplete information', 'Conformant/Contingent planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/725,"This paper proposes a generic approach to planning in the presence of incomplete information. The approach builds on an abstract notion of a belief state representation, along with an associated set of basic operations. These operations facilitate the development of a sound and complete transition function, for reasoning about effects of actions in the presence of incomplete information, and a set of abstract algorithms for planning. The paper demonstrates how the abstract definitions and algorithms can be instantiated in three concrete representations—minimal-DNF, minimal-CNF, and prime implicates—resulting in three highly competitive conformant planners: DNF, CNF, and PIP. The paper relates the notion of a representation to that of ordered binary decision diagrams, a well-known belief state representation employed by many conformant planners, and several target compilation languages that have been presented in the literature.The paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the planners DNF, CNF, and PIP and proposes a new set of conformant planning benchmarks that are challenging for state-of-the-art conformant planners."

Belief filtering in DBNs is the task of inferring the belief state (i.e. the probability distribution over process states) based on incomplete and uncertain observations. In this article, we explore the idea of accelerating the filtering task by automatically exploiting causality in the process. We consider a specific type of causal relation, called passivity, which pertains to how state variables cause changes in other variables. We present the Passivity-based Selective Belief Filtering (PSBF) method, which maintains a factored belief representation and exploits passivity to perform selective updates over the belief factors. PSBF is evaluated in both synthetic processes and a simulated multi-robot warehouse, where it outperformed alternative filtering methods by exploiting passivity."

Large cities such as Manchester struggle to meet air quality limits as the range of available traffic management devices is limited. In the study, we investigated the application of linked data to enrich environmental and traffic data feeds, and we used this with automated planning tools to enable traffic to be managed at a region level. The management will have the aim of avoiding air pollution problems before they occur.
