0,Time-Constrained Participatory Budgeting Under Uncertain Project Costs,Main,['Planning with Incomplete Information'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/11,"In participatory budgeting the stakeholders collectively decide which projects from a set of proposed projects should be implemented. This decision underlies both time and monetary constraints. In reality it is often impossible to figure out the exact cost of each project in advance, it is only known after a project is finished. To reduce risk, one can implement projects one after the other to be able to react to higher costs of a previous project. However, this will increase execution time drastically. We generalize existing frameworks to capture this setting, study desirable properties of algorithms for this problem, and show that some desirable properties are incompatible. Then we present and analyze algorithms that trade-off desirable properties."
1,Propositional Gossip Protocols under Fair Schedulers,Main,"['Distributed; Multi-agent Planning', 'Theoretical Foundations of Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/56,"Gossip protocols are programs that can be used by a group of agents to synchronize what information they have. Namely, assuming each agent holds a secret, the goal of a protocol is to reach a situation in which all agents know all secrets. Distributed epistemic gossip protocols use epistemic formulas in the component programs for the agents. In this paper, we study the simplest classes of such gossip protocols: propositional gossip protocols, in which whether an agent wants to initiate a call depends only on the set of secrets that the agent currently knows. It was recently shown that such a protocol can be correct, i.e., always terminates in a state where all agents know all secrets, only when its communication graph is complete. We show here that this characterization dramatically changes when the usual fairness constraints are imposed on the call scheduler used. Finally, we establish that checking the correctness of a given propositional protocol under a fair scheduler is a coNP-complete problem."
2,Real-Time BDI Agents: A Model and Its Implementation,Main,"['Scheduling', 'Real-time Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/73,"The BDI model proved to be effective for the developing of applications requiring high-levels of autonomy and to deal with the complexity and unpredictability of real-world scenarios. The model, however, has significant limitations in reacting and handling contingencies within the given real-time constraints. Without an explicit representation of time, existing real-time BDI implementations overlook the temporal implications during the agent’s decision process that may result in delays or unresponsiveness of the system when it gets overloaded. In this paper, we redefine the BDI agent control loop inspired by traditional and well establish algorithms for real-time systems to ensure a proper reaction of agents and their effective application in typical real-time domains. Our model proposes an effective real-time management of goals, plans, and actions with respect to time constraints and resources availability. We propose an implementation of the model for a resource-collection video-game and we validate the approach against a set of significant scenarios."
3,Max-Sum with Quadtrees for Decentralized Coordination in Continuous Domains,Main,['Distributed; Multi-agent Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/74,"In this paper we put forward a novel extension of the classic Max-Sum algorithm to the framework of Continuous Distributed Constrained Optimization Problems (Continuous DCOPs), by utilizing a popular geometric algorithm, namely Quadtrees. In its standard form, Max-Sum can only solve Continuous DCOPs with an a priori discretization procedure. Existing Max-Sum extensions to continuous multiagent coordination domains require additional assumptions regarding the form of the factors, such as access to the gradient, or the ability to model them as continuous piecewise linear functions. Our proposed approach has no such requirements: we model the exchanged messages with Quadtrees, and, as such, the discretization procedure is dynamic and embedded in the internal Max-Sum operations (addition and marginal maximization). We apply Max-Sum with Quadtrees to lane-free autonomous driving. Our experimental evaluation showcases the effectiveness of our approach in this challenging coordination domain."
4,Fast and Fine-grained Autoscaler for Streaming Jobs with Reinforcement Learning,Main,['Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/80,"On computing clusters, the autoscaler is responsible for allocating resources for jobs or fine-grained tasks to ensure their Quality of Service. Due to a more precise resource management, fine-grained autoscaling can generally achieve better performance. However, the fine-grained autoscaling for streaming jobs needs intensive computation to model the complicated running states of tasks, and has not been adequately studied previously. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained autoscaler for streaming jobs based on reinforcement learning. We first organize the running states of streaming jobs as spatio-temporal graphs. To efficiently make autoscaling decisions, we propose a Neural Variational Subgraph Sampler to sample spatio-temporal subgraphs. Furthermore, we propose a mutual-information-based objective function to explicitly guide the sampler to extract more representative subgraphs. After that, the autoscaler makes decisions based on the learned subgraph representations. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over six competitive baselines."
5,Environment Design for Biased Decision Makers,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/84,"We study the environment design problem for biased decision makers. In an environment design problem, an informed principal aims to update the decision making environment to influence the decisions made by the agent. This problem is ubiquitous in various domains, e.g., a social networking platform might want to update its website to encourage more user engagement. In this work, we focus on the scenario in which the agent might exhibit biases in decision making. We relax the common assumption that the agent is rational and aim to incorporate models of biased agents in environment design. We formulate the environment design problem under the Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporate common models of biased agents through introducing general time-discounting functions. We then formalize the environment design problem as constrained optimization problems and propose corresponding algorithms. We conduct both simulations and real human-subject experiments with workers recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate our proposed algorithms."
6,Beyond Strong-Cyclic: Doing Your Best in Stochastic Environments,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/350,"``Strong-cyclic policies"" were introduced to formalize trial-and-error strategies and are known to work in Markovian stochastic domains, i.e., they guarantee that the goal is reached with probability 1. We introduce ``best-effort"" policies for (not necessarily Markovian) stochastic domains. These generalize strong-cyclic policies by taking advantage of stochasticity even if the goal cannot be reached with probability 1. We compare such policies with optimal policies, i.e., policies that maximize the probability that the goal is achieved, and show that optimal policies are best-effort, but that the converse is false in general. With this framework at hand, we revisit the foundational problem of what it means to plan in nondeterministic domains when the nondeterminism has a stochastic nature. We show that one can view a nondeterministic planning domain as a representation of infinitely many stochastic domains with the same support but different probabilities, and that for temporally extended goals expressed in LTL/LTLf a finite-state best-effort policy in one of these domains is best-effort in each of the domains. In particular, this gives an approach for finding such policies that reduces to solving finite-state MDPs with LTL/LTLf goals. All this shows that ``best-effort"" policies are robust to changes in the probabilities, as long as the support is unchanged."
7,LTLf Synthesis as AND-OR Graph Search: Knowledge Compilation at Work,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/359,"Synthesis techniques for temporal logic specifications are typically based on exploiting symbolic techniques, as done in model checking. These symbolic techniques typically use backward fixpoint computation. Planning, which can be seen as a specific form of synthesis, is a witness of the success of forward search approaches. In this paper, we develop a forward-search approach to full-fledged Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf) synthesis. We show how to compute the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of an LTLf formula on-the-fly, while performing an adversarial forward search towards the final states, by considering the DFA as a sort of AND-OR graph. Our approach is characterized by branching on suitable propositional formulas, instead of individual evaluations, hence radically reducing the branching factor of the search space. Specifically, we take advantage of techniques developed for knowledge compilation, such as Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs), to implement the approach efficiently."
8,Reinforcement Learning with Option Machines,Main,['Planning with Incomplete Information'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/403,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for learning complex behaviors, but lacks adoption in many settings due to sample size requirements. We introduce a framework for increasing sample efficiency of RL algorithms. Our approach focuses on optimizing environment rewards with high-level instructions. These are modeled as a high-level controller over temporally extended actions known as options. These options can be looped, interleaved and partially ordered with a rich language for high-level instructions. Crucially, the instructions may be underspecified in the sense that following them does not guarantee high reward in the environment. We present an algorithm for control with these so-called option machines (OMs), discuss option selection for the partially ordered case and describe an algorithm for learning with OMs. We compare our approach in zero-shot, single- and multi-task settings in an environment with fully specified and underspecified instructions. We find that OMs perform significantly better than or comparable to the state-of-art in all environments and learning settings."
9,Option Transfer and SMDP Abstraction with Successor Features,Main,['Hierarchical Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/421,"Abstraction plays an important role in the generalisation of knowledge and skills and is key to sample efficient learning. In this work, we study joint temporal and state abstraction in reinforcement learning, where temporally-extended actions in the form of options induce temporal abstractions, while aggregation of similar states with respect to abstract options induces state abstractions. Many existing abstraction schemes ignore the interplay of state and temporal abstraction. Consequently, the considered option policies often cannot be directly transferred to new environments due to changes in the state space and transition dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel abstraction scheme building on successor features. This includes an algorithm for transferring abstract options across different environments and a state abstraction mechanism that allows us to perform efficient planning with the transferred options."
10,Relational Abstractions for Generalized Reinforcement Learning on Symbolic Problems,Main,['Learning in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/435,"Reinforcement learning in problems with symbolic state spaces is challenging due to the need for reasoning over long horizons. This paper presents a new approach that utilizes relational abstractions in conjunction with deep learning to learn a generalizable Q-function for such problems. The learned Q-function can be efficiently transferred to related problems that have different object names and object quantities, and thus, entirely different state spaces. We show that the learned, generalized Q-function can be utilized for zero-shot transfer to related problems without an explicit, hand-coded curriculum. Empirical evaluations on a range of problems show that our method facilitates efficient zero-shot transfer of learned knowledge to much larger problem instances containing many objects."
11,Data Augmentation for Learning to Play in Text-Based Games,Main,['POMDPs'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/436,"Improving generalization in text-based games serves as a useful stepping-stone towards reinforcement learning (RL) agents with generic linguistic ability. Data augmentation for generalization in RL has shown to be very successful in classic control and visual tasks, but there is no prior work for text-based games. We propose Transition-Matching Permutation, a novel data augmentation technique for text-based games, where we identify phrase permutations that match as many transitions in the trajectory data. We show that applying this technique results in state-of-the-art performance in the Cooking Game benchmark suite for text-based games."
12,Markov Abstractions for PAC Reinforcement Learning in Non-Markov Decision Processes,Main,['Markov Decisions Processes'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/473,"Our work aims at developing reinforcement learning algorithms that do not rely on the Markov assumption. We consider the class of Non-Markov Decision Processes where histories can be abstracted into a finite set of states while preserving the dynamics. We call it a Markov abstraction since it induces a Markov Decision Process over a set of states that encode the non-Markov dynamics. This phenomenon underlies the recently introduced Regular Decision Processes (as well as POMDPs where only a finite number of belief states is reachable). In all such kinds of decision process, an agent that uses a Markov abstraction can rely on the Markov property to achieve optimal behaviour. We show that Markov abstractions can be learned during reinforcement learning. Our approach combines automata learning and classic reinforcement learning. For these two tasks, standard algorithms can be employed. We show that our approach has PAC guarantees when the employed algorithms have PAC guarantees, and we also provide an experimental evaluation."
13,Value Refinement Network (VRN),Main,['Learning in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/494,"In robotic tasks, we encounter the unique strengths of (1) reinforcement learning (RL) that can handle high-dimensional observations as well as unknown, complex dynamics and (2) planning that can handle sparse and delayed rewards given a dynamics model. Combining these strengths of RL and planning, we propose the Value Refinement Network (VRN), in this work. Our VRN is an RL-trained neural network architecture that learns to locally refine an initial (value-based) plan in a simplified (2D) problem abstraction based on detailed local sensory observations. We evaluate the VRN on simulated robotic (navigation) tasks and demonstrate that it can successfully refine sub-optimal plans to match the performance of more costly planning in the non-simplified problem. Furthermore, in a dynamic environment, the VRN still enables high task completion without global re-planning."
14,Model-Based Offline Planning with Trajectory Pruning,Main,"['Markov Decisions Processes', 'Planning Algorithms']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/516,"The recent offline reinforcement learning (RL) studies have achieved much progress to make RL usable in real-world systems by learning policies from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction. Unfortunately, existing offline RL methods still face many practical challenges in real-world system control tasks, such as computational restriction during agent training and the requirement of extra control flexibility. The model-based planning framework provides an attractive alternative. However, most model-based planning algorithms are not designed for offline settings. Simply combining the ingredients of offline RL with existing methods either provides over-restrictive planning or leads to inferior performance. We propose a new light-weighted model-based offline planning framework, namely MOPP, which tackles the dilemma between the restrictions of offline learning and high-performance planning. MOPP encourages more aggressive trajectory rollout guided by the behavior policy learned from data, and prunes out problematic trajectories to avoid potential out-of-distribution samples. Experimental results show that MOPP provides competitive performance compared with existing model-based offline planning and RL approaches."
15,Offline Vehicle Routing Problem with Online Bookings: A Novel Problem Formulation with Applications to Paratransit,Main,['Learning in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/546,"Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) can be divided into two major categories: offline VRPs, which consider a given set of trip requests to be served, and online VRPs, which consider requests as they arrive in real-time. Based on discussions with public transit agencies, we identify a real-world problem that is not addressed by existing formulations: booking trips with flexible pickup windows (e.g., 3 hours) in advance (e.g., the day before) and confirming tight pickup windows (e.g., 30 minutes) at the time of booking. Such a service model is often required in paratransit service settings, where passengers typically book trips for the next day over the phone. To address this gap between offline and online problems, we introduce a novel formulation, the offline vehicle routing problem with online bookings. This problem is very challenging computationally since it faces the complexity of considering large sets of requests—similar to offline VRPs—but must abide by strict constraints on running time—similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a learning-based policy for real-time decisions. Based on a paratransit dataset obtained from the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN, we demonstrate that our novel formulation and computational approach lead to significantly better outcomes in this setting than existing algorithms."
16,Explaining the Behaviour of Hybrid Systems with PDDL+ Planning,Main,"['Mixed Discrete/Continuous Planning', 'Activity and Plan Recognition']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/634,"The aim of this work is to explain the observed behaviour of a hybrid system (HS). The explanation problem is cast as finding a trajectory of the HS that matches some observations. By using the formalism of hybrid automata (HA), we characterize the explanations as the language of a network of HA that comprises one automaton for the HS and another one for the observations, thus restricting the behaviour of the HS exclusively to trajectories that explain the observations. We observe that this problem corresponds to a reachability problem in model-checking, but that state-of-the-art model checkers struggle to find concrete trajectories. To overcome this issue we provide a formal mapping from HA to PDDL+ and show how to use an off-the-shelf automated planner. An experimental analysis over domains with piece-wise constant, linear and nonlinear dynamics reveals that the proposed PDDL+ approach is much more efficient than solving directly the explanation problem with model-checking solvers."
17,Online Bin Packing with Predictions,Main,"['Learning in Planning and Scheduling', 'Planning under Uncertainty', 'Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/635,"Bin packing is a classic optimization problem with a wide range of applications from load balancing to supply chain management. In this work, we study the online variant of the problem, in which a sequence of items of various sizes must be placed into a minimum number of bins of uniform capacity. The online algorithm is enhanced with a (potentially erroneous) prediction concerning the frequency of item sizes in the sequence. We design and analyze online algorithms with efficient tradeoffs between the consistency (i.e., the competitive ratio assuming no prediction error) and the robustness (i.e., the competitive ratio under adversarial error), and whose performance degrades near-optimally as a function of the prediction error. This is the first theoretical and experimental study of online bin packing in the realistic setting of learnable predictions. Previous work addressed only extreme cases with respect to the prediction error, and relied on overly powerful and error-free oracles."
18,Scheduling with Untrusted Predictions,Main,"['Scheduling', 'Learning in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/636,"Using machine-learned predictions to create algorithms with better approximation guarantees is a very fresh and active field. In this work, we study classic scheduling problems under the learning augmented setting. More specifically, we consider the problem of scheduling jobs with arbitrary release dates on a single machine and the problem of scheduling jobs with a common release date on multiple machines. Our objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. For both problems, we propose algorithms which use predictions for taking their decisions. Our algorithms are consistent -- i.e. when the predictions are accurate, the performances of our algorithms are close to those of an  optimal offline algorithm--, and robust -- i.e.  when the predictions are wrong, the performance of our algorithms are close to those of an online algorithm without predictions. In addition, we confirm the above theoretical bounds by conducting experimental evaluation comparing the proposed algorithms to the offline optimal ones for both the single and multiple machines settings."
19,Adaptive Information Belief Space Planning,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Planning Algorithms', 'Planning with Incomplete Information', 'POMDPs', 'Robot Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/637,"Reasoning about uncertainty is vital in many real-life autonomous systems. However, current state-of-the-art planning algorithms either cannot reason about uncertainty explicitly, or do so with high computational burden. Here, we focus on making informed decisions efficiently, using reward functions that explicitly deal with uncertainty. We formulate an approximation, namely an abstract observation model, that uses an aggregation scheme to alleviate computational costs. We derive bounds on the expected information-theoretic reward function and, as a consequence, on the value function. We then propose a method to refine aggregation to achieve identical action selection in a fraction of the computational time."
20,Tight Bounds for Hybrid Planning,Main,"['Hierarchical Planning', 'Theoretical Foundations of Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/638,"Several hierarchical planning systems feature a rich level of language features making them capable of expressing real-world problems. One such feature that's used by several current planning systems is causal links, which are used to track search progress. The formalism combining Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning with these links known from Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) planning is often referred to as hybrid planning. In this paper we study the computational complexity of such hybrid planning problems. More specifically, we provide missing membership results to existing hardness proofs and thereby provide tight complexity bounds for all known subclasses of hierarchical planning problems. We also re-visit and correct a result from the literature for plan verification showing that it remains NP-complete even in the absence of a task hierarchy."
21,Planning with Qualitative Action-Trajectory Constraints in PDDL,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/639,"In automated planning the ability of expressing constraints on the structure of the desired plans is important to deal with solution quality, as well as to express control knowledge. In PDDL3, this is supported through state-trajectory constraints corresponding to a class of LTLf formulae. In this paper,  first we introduce a formalism to express trajectory constraints over actions in the plan, rather than over traversed states; Then we investigate compilation-based methods to deal with such constraints in propositional planning, and propose a new simple effective method. Finally, we experimentally study the usefulness of our action-trajectory constraints as a tool to express control knowledge. The experimental results show that the performance of a classical planner can be significantly improved by exploiting knowledge expressed by action constraints and handled by our compilation method, while the same knowledge turns out to be less beneficial when specified as state constraints and handled by two state-of-the-art systems supporting state constraints."
22,Shared Autonomy Systems with Stochastic Operator Models,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Markov Decisions Processes']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/640,"We consider shared autonomy systems where multiple operators (AI and human), can interact with the environment, e.g. by controlling a robot. The decision problem for the shared autonomy system is to select which operator takes control at each timestep, such that a reward specifying the intended system behaviour is maximised. The performance of the human operator is influenced by unobserved factors, such as fatigue or skill level. Therefore, the system must reason over stochastic models of operator performance. We present a framework for stochastic operators in shared autonomy systems (SO-SAS), where we represent operators using rich, partially observable models. We formalise SO-SAS as a mixed-observability Markov decision process, where environment states are fully observable and internal operator states are hidden. We test SO-SAS on a simulated domain and a computer game, empirically showing it results in better performance compared to traditional formulations of shared autonomy systems."
23,Explaining Soft-Goal Conflicts through Constraint Relaxations,Main,['Planning Algorithms'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/641,"Recent work suggests to explain trade-offs between soft-goals in terms of their conflicts, i.e., minimal unsolvable soft-goal subsets. But this does not explain the conflicts themselves: Why can a given set of soft-goals not be jointly achieved? Here we approach that question in terms of the underlying constraints on plans in the task at hand, namely resource availability and time windows. In this context, a natural form of explanation for a soft-goal conflict is a minimal constraint relaxation under which the conflict disappears (``if the deadline was 1 hour later, it would work''). We explore algorithms for computing such explanations. A baseline is to simply loop over all relaxed tasks and compute the conflicts for each separately. We improve over this by two algorithms that leverage information -- conflicts, reachable states -- across relaxed tasks. We show that these algorithms can exponentially outperform the baseline in theory, and we run experiments confirming that advantage in practice."
24,Online Planning in POMDPs with Self-Improving Simulators,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Planning Algorithms', 'POMDPs', 'Real-time Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/642,"How  can  we  plan  efficiently  in  a  large  and  complex environment when the time budget is limited? Given  the  original  simulator  of  the  environment, which may be computationally very demanding, we propose to learn online an approximate but much faster simulator that improves over time.  To plan reliably and efficiently while the approximate simulator is learning, we develop a method that adaptively decides which simulator to use for every simulation, based on a statistic that measures the accuracy of the approximate simulator. This allows us to use the approximate simulator to replace the original simulator for faster simulations when it is accurate enough under the current context, thus trading off  simulation speed  and  accuracy.   Experimental results in two large domains show that when integrated with POMCP, our approach allows to plan with improving efficiency over time."
25,An Efficient Approach to Data Transfer Scheduling for Long Range Space Exploration,Main,"['Applications', 'Scheduling', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/643,"Long range space missions, such as Rosetta, require robust plans of data-acquisition activities and of the resulting data transfers. In this paper we revisit the problem of assigning priorities to data transfers in order to maximize safety margin of onboard memory. We propose a fast sweep algorithm to verify the feasibility of a given priority assignment and we introduce an efficient exact algorithm to assign priorities on a single downlink window. We prove that the problem is NP-hard for several windows, and we propose several randomized heuristics to tackle the general case. Our experimental results show that  the proposed approaches are able to  improve the plans computed for the real mission by the previously existing method, while the sweep algorithm yields drastic accelerations."

Given a graph and a set of start-goal pairs, the problem consists in assigning a path to each agent such that every agent eventually reaches their goal without blocking each other, regardless of how the agents are being scheduled at runtime. The motivation stems from the nature of distributed environments that agents take actions fully asynchronous and have no knowledge about those exact timings of other actors. We present solution conditions, computational complexity, solvers, and robotic applications."
28,On the Computational Complexity of Model Reconciliations,Main,['Theoretical Foundations of Planning'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/646,"Model-reconciliation explanation is a popular framework for generating explanations for planning problems. While the framework has been extended to multiple settings since its introduction for classical planning problems, there is little agreement on the computational complexity of generating minimal model reconciliation explanations in the basic setting.

29,Landmark Heuristics for Lifted Classical Planning,Main,"['Search in Planning and Scheduling', 'Planning Algorithms']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/647,"While state-of-the-art planning systems need a grounded (propositional) task representation, the input model is provided ""lifted"", specifying predicates and action schemas with variables over a finite object universe. The size of the grounded model is exponential in predicate/action-schema arity, limiting applicability to cases where it is small enough. Recent work has taken up this challenge, devising an effective lifted forward search planner as basis for lifted heuristic search, as well as a variety of lifted heuristic functions based on the delete relaxation. Here we add a novel family of lifted heuristic functions, based on landmarks. We design two methods for landmark extraction in the lifted setting. The resulting heuristics exhibit performance advantages over previous heuristics in several benchmark domains. Especially the combination with lifted delete relaxation heuristics to a LAMA-style planner yields good results, beating the previous state of the art in lifted planning."
30,Competitive Analysis for Multi-Commodity Ski-Rental Problem,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Applications', 'Theoretical Foundations of Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/648,"We investigate an extended version of the classical ski-rental problem with multiple commodities. A customer uses a set of commodities altogether, and he/she needs to choose payment options to cover the usage of each commodity without the knowledge of the future. The payment options of each commodity include (1) renting: to pay for an on-demand usage and (2) buying: to pay for the lifetime usage. It is a novel extension of the classical ski-rental problem which deals with only one commodity. To address this problem, we propose a new online algorithm called the Multi-Object Break-Even (MOBE) algorithm and conduct competitive analysis. We show that the tight lower and upper bounds of MOBE algorithm's competitive ratio are e/e-1 and 2 respectively against adaptive adversary under arbitrary renting and buying prices. We further prove that MOBE algorithm is an optimal online algorithm if commodities have the same rent-to-buy ratio. Numerical results verify our theoretical conclusion and demonstrate the advantages of MOBE in a real-world scenario."
31,An Online Learning Approach towards Far-sighted Emergency Relief Planning under Intentional Attacks in Conflict Areas,Main,"['Planning under Uncertainty', 'Mixed Discrete/Continuous Planning', 'Real-time Planning']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/649,"A large number of emergency humanitarian rescue demands in conflict areas around the world are accompanied by intentional, persistent and unpredictable attacks on rescuers and supplies. Unfortunately, existing work on humanitarian relief planning mostly ignores this challenge in reality resulting a parlous and short-sighted relief distribution plan to a large extent. To address this, we first propose an offline multi-stage optimization problem of emergency relief planning under intentional attacks, in which all parameters in the game between the rescuer and attacker are supposed to be known or predictable. Then, an online version of this problem is introduced to meet the need of online and irrevocable decision making when those parameters are revealed in an online fashion. To achieve a far-sighted emergency relief planning under attacks, we design an online learning approach which is proven to obtain a near-optimal solution of the offline problem when those online reveled parameters are i.i.d. sampled from an unknown distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on a real anti-Ebola relief planning case based on the data of Ebola outbreak and armed attacks in DRC Congo show the scalability and effectiveness of our approach."
32,PG3: Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generation,Main,['Learning in Planning and Scheduling'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/650,"A longstanding objective in classical planning is to synthesize policies that generalize across multiple problems from the same domain. In this work, we study generalized policy search-based methods with a focus on the score function used to guide the search over policies. We demonstrate limitations of two score functions --- policy evaluation and plan comparison --- and propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations. The main idea behind our approach, Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generalization (PG3), is that a candidate policy should be used to guide planning on training problems as a mechanism for evaluating that candidate. Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under which PG3 is optimal or admissible. We then study a specific instantiation of policy search where planning problems are PDDL-based and policies are lifted decision lists. Empirical results in six domains confirm that PG3 learns generalized policies more efficiently and effectively than several baselines."
33,A Native Qualitative Numeric Planning Solver Based on AND/OR Graph Search,Main,"['Planning Algorithms', 'Planning under Uncertainty']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/651,"Qualitative numeric planning (QNP) is classical planning extended with non-negative real variables that can be increased or decreased by some arbitrary amount. Existing approaches for solving QNP problems are exclusively based on compilation to fully observable nondeterministic planning (FOND) problems or FOND+ problems, i.e., FOND problems with explicit fairness assumptions. However, the FOND-compilation approaches suffer from some limitations, such as difficulties to generate all strong cyclic solutions for FOND problems or introducing a great many extra variables and actions. In this paper, we propose a simpler characterization of QNP solutions and a new approach to solve QNP problems based on directly searching for a solution, which is a closed and terminating subgraph that contains a goal node, in the AND/OR graphs induced by QNP problems. Moreover, we introduce a pruning strategy based on termination tests on subgraphs. We implemented a native solver DSET based on the proposed approach and compared the performance of it with that of the two compilation-based approaches. Experimental results show that DSET is faster than the FOND-compilation approach by one order of magnitude, and comparable with the FOND+-compilation approach."

We focus on the  dispatching-pricing problem to maximize the total revenue while keeping both drivers and riders satisfied. We study the computational complexity of the problem, provide a novel two-phased pricing solution with revenue and fairness guarantees, extend it to stochastic settings and develop a dynamic (a.k.a., learning-while-doing) algorithm that actively collects data to learn the demand distribution during the scheduling process. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms."
35,Learning and Exploiting Progress States in Greedy Best-First Search,Main,"['Learning in Planning and Scheduling', 'Search in Planning and Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/657,"Previous work introduced the concept of progress states. After expanding a progress state, a greedy best-first search (GBFS) will only expand states with lower heuristic values. Current methods can identify progress states only for a single task and only after a solution for the task has been found. We introduce a novel approach that learns a description logic formula characterizing all progress states in a classical planning domain. Using the learned formulas in a GBFS to break ties in favor of progress states often significantly reduces the search effort."
36,Completeness and Diversity in Depth-First Proof-Number Search with Applications to Retrosynthesis,Main,['Planning Algorithms'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/658,"We revisit Depth-First Proof-Number Search (DFPN), a well-known algorithm for solving two-player games. First, we consider the completeness property of the algorithm and its variants, i.e., whether they always find a winning strategy when there exists one. While it is known that the standard version is not complete, we show that the combination with the simple Threshold Controlling Algorithm is complete, solving an open problem from the area. Second, we modify DFPN to compute a diverse set of solutions rather than just a single one. Finally, we apply this new variant in Chemistry to the synthesis planning of new target molecules (Retrosynthesis). In this domain a diverse set of many solutions is desirable. We apply additional modifications from the literature to the algorithm and show that it outperforms Monte-Carlo Tree-Search, another well-known algorithm for the same problem, according to a natural diversity measure."
37,A Reliability-aware Distributed Framework to Schedule Residential Charging of Electric Vehicles,AI for Good,"['Distributed; Multi-agent Planning', 'Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/710,"Residential consumers have become active participants in the power distribution network after being equipped with residential EV charging provisions. This creates a challenge for the network operator tasked with dispatching electric power to the residential consumers through the existing distribution network infrastructure in a reliable manner. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling residential EV charging for multiple consumers while maintaining network reliability. An additional challenge is the restricted exchange of information: where the consumers do not have access to network information and the network operator does not have access  to consumer load parameters. We propose a distributed framework which generates an optimal EV charging schedule for individual residential consumers based on their preferences and iteratively updates it until the network reliability constraints set by the operator are satisfied. We validate the proposed approach for different EV adoption levels in a synthetically created digital twin of an actual power distribution network. The results demonstrate that the new approach can achieve a higher level of network reliability compared to the case where residential consumers charge EVs based solely on their individual preferences, thus providing a solution for the existing grid to keep up with increased adoption rates without significant investments in increasing grid capacity."
38,Ranked Prioritization of Groups in Combinatorial Bandit Allocation,AI for Good,['Planning under Uncertainty'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/723,"Preventing poaching through ranger patrols protects endangered wildlife, directly contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 of life on land. Combinatorial bandits have been used to allocate limited patrol resources, but existing approaches overlook the fact that each location is home to multiple species in varying proportions, so a patrol benefits each species to differing degrees. When some species are more vulnerable, we ought to offer more protection to these animals; unfortunately, existing combinatorial bandit approaches do not offer a way to prioritize important species. To bridge this gap, (1) We propose a novel combinatorial bandit objective that trades off between reward maximization and also accounts for prioritization over species, which we call ranked prioritization. We show this objective can be expressed as a weighted linear sum of Lipschitz-continuous reward functions. (2) We provide RankedCUCB, an algorithm to select combinatorial actions that optimize our prioritization-based objective, and prove that it achieves asymptotic no-regret. (3) We demonstrate empirically that RankedCUCB leads to up to 38% improvement in outcomes for endangered species using real-world wildlife conservation data. Along with adapting to other challenges such as preventing illegal logging and overfishing, our no-regret algorithm addresses the general combinatorial bandit problem with a weighted linear objective."
39,VMAgent: A Practical Virtual Machine Scheduling Platform,Demo,"['Learning in Planning and Scheduling', 'Scheduling']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/860,"Virtual machine (VM) scheduling is one of the critical tasks in cloud computing. Many works have attempted to incorporate machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, to empower VM scheduling procedures. Although improved results are shown in several demo simulators, the performances in real-world scenarios are still underexploited. In this paper, we design a practical VM scheduling platform, i.e., VMAgent, to assist researchers in developing their methods on the VM scheduling problem. VMAgent consists of three components: simulator, scheduler, and visualizer. The simulator abstracts three general realistic scheduling scenarios (fading, recovering, and expansion) based on Huawei Cloud’s scheduling data, which is the core of our platform. Flexible configurations are further provided to make the simulator compatible with practical cloud computing architecture (i.e., Multi Non-Uniform Memory Access) and scenarios. Researchers then need to instantiate the scheduler to interact with the simulator, which is also pre-built in various types (e.g., heuristic, machine learning, and operations research) of scheduling algorithms to speed up the algorithm design. The visualizer, as an auxiliary component of the simulator and scheduler, facilitates researchers to conduct an in-depth analysis of the scheduling procedure and comprehensively compare different scheduling algorithms. We believe that VMAgent would shed light on the AI for the VM scheduling community, and the demo video is presented in https://bit.ly/vmagent-demo-video."
