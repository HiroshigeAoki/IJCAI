0,Representativeness-aware Aspect Analysis for Brand Monitoring in Social Media,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/44,"Owing to the fast-responding nature and extreme success of social media, many companies resort to social media sites for monitoring their brands’ reputation and the opinions of general public. To help companies monitor their brands, in this work, we delve into the task of extracting representative aspects and posts from users’ free-text posts in social media. Previous efforts have treated it as a traditional information extraction task, and forgo the specific properties of social media, such as the possible noise in user generated posts and the varying impacts; In contrast, we extract aspects by maximizing their representativeness, which is a new notion defined by us that accounts for both the coverage of aspects and the impact of posts. We formalize it as a submodular optimization problem, and develop a FastPAS algorithm to jointly select representative posts and aspects. The FastPAS algorithm optimizes parameters in a greedy way, which is highly efficient and can reach a good solution with theoretical guarantees. We perform extensive experiments on two datasets, showing that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art aspect extraction and summarization methods in identifying representative aspects."
1,Inferring Implicit Event Locations from Context with Distributional Similarities,Main,"['Discourse', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/136,"Automatic event location extraction from text plays a crucial role in many applications such as infectious disease surveillance and natural disaster monitoring. The fundamental limitation of previous work such as SpaceEval is the limited scope of extraction, targeting only at locations that are explicitly stated in a syntactic structure. This leads to missing a lot of implicit information inferable from context in a document, which amounts to nearly 40% of the entire location information. To overcome this limitation for the first time, we present a system that infers the implicit event locations from a given document. Our system exploits distributional semantics, based on the hypothesis that if two events are described by similar expressions, it is likely that they occur in the same location. For example, if “A bomb exploded causing 30 victims” and “many people died from terrorist attack in Boston” are reported in the same document, it is highly likely that the bomb exploded in Boston. Our system shows good performance of a 0.58 F1-score, where state-of-the-art classifiers for intra-sentential spatiotemporal relations achieve around 0.60 F1-scores."
2,Relatedness-based Multi-Entity Summarization,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/147,"Representing world knowledge in a machine processable format is important as entities and their descriptions have fueled tremendous growth in knowledge-rich information processing platforms, services, and systems. Prominent applications of knowledge graphs include search engines (e.g., Google Search and Microsoft Bing), email clients (e.g., Gmail), and intelligent personal assistants (e.g., Google Now, Amazon Echo, and Apple's Siri). In this paper, we present an approach that can summarize facts about a collection of entities by analyzing their relatedness in preference to summarizing each entity in isolation. Specifically, we generate informative entity summaries by selecting: (i) inter-entity facts  that are similar  and (ii) intra-entity facts that are important and diverse. We employ a constrained knapsack problem solving approach to efficiently compute entity summaries. We perform both qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate that our approach yields promising results compared to two other stand-alone state-of-the-art entity summarization approaches."
3,Explicit Knowledge-based Reasoning for Visual Question Answering,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/179,"We describe a method for visual question answering which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of information extracted from a large-scale knowledge base. The method not only answers natural language questions using concepts not contained in the image, but can explain the reasoning by which it developed its answer. It is capable of answering far more complex questions than the predominant long short-term memory-based approach, and outperforms it significantly in testing. We also provide a dataset and a protocol by which to evaluate general visual question answering methods."
4,Knowledge Graph Representation with Jointly Structural and Textual Encoding,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/183,"The objective of knowledge graph embedding is to encode both entities and relations of knowledge graphs into continuous low-dimensional vector spaces. Previously, most works focused on symbolic representation of knowledge graph with structure information, which can not handle  new entities or entities with few facts well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture to utilize both structural and textual information of entities. Specifically, we introduce three neural models to encode the valuable information from text description of entity, among which an attentive model can select related information as needed. Then, a gating mechanism is applied to integrate representations of structure and text into a unified architecture. Experiments show that our models outperform baseline and obtain state-of-the-art results on link prediction and triplet classification tasks."
5,RHash: Robust Hashing via L_infinity-norm Distortion,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/192,"Hashing is an important tool in large-scale machine learning. Unfortunately, current data-dependent hashing algorithms are not robust to small perturbations of the data points, which degrades the performance of nearest neighbor (NN) search. The culprit is the minimization of the L_2-norm, average distortion among pairs of points to find the hash function. Inspired by recent progress in robust optimization, we develop a novel hashing algorithm, dubbed RHash, that instead minimizes the L_1-norm, worst-case distortion among pairs of points. We develop practical and efficient implementations of RHash that couple the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework with column generation to scale well to large datasets. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of RHash over ten state-of-the-art binary hashing schemes. In particular, we show that RHash achieves the same retrieval performance as the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of average precision while using up to 60% fewer bits."
6,Using Graphs of Classifiers to Impose Declarative Constraints on Semi-supervised Learning,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/201,"We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. Specifically, we present a declarative language for modeling both traditional supervised classification tasks and many SSL heuristics, including both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that multiple heuristics can be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization methods. We experiment with two classes of tasks, link-based text classification and relation extraction.  We show modest improvements on well-studied link-based classification benchmarks, and state-of-the-art results on relation-extraction tasks for two realistic domains."
7,Human-Centric Justification of Machine Learning Predictions,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/202,"Human decision makers in many domains can make use of predictions made by machine learning models in their decision making process, but the usability of these predictions is limited if the human is unable to justify his or her trust in the prediction. We propose a novel approach to producing justifications that is geared towards users without machine learning expertise, focusing on domain knowledge and on human reasoning, and utilizing natural language generation. Through a task-based experiment, we show that our approach significantly helps humans to correctly decide whether or not predictions are accurate, and significantly increases their satisfaction with the justification."
8,Multiple-Weight Recurrent Neural Networks,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/205,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have enjoyed great success in speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Many variants of RNNs have been proposed, including vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. However, current architectures are not particularly  adept at dealing with tasks involving multi-faceted contents. In this work, we solve this problem by proposing Multiple-Weight RNNs and LSTMs, which rely on multiple weight matrices in an attempt to mimic the human ability of switching between contexts. We present a framework for adapting RNN-based models and analyze the properties of this approach. Our detailed experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work across a range of different tasks and datasets."
9,Multilingual Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Cross-lingual Knowledge Alignment,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/209,"Many recent works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embeddings in completing monolingual knowledge graphs. Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable cross-lingual alignment by human labor is very costly and error-prone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart."
10,Extracting Visual Knowledge from the Web with Multimodal Learning,Main,"['Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/238,"We consider the problem of automatically extracting visual objects from web images. Despite the extraordinary advancement in deep learning, visual object detection remains a challenging task. To overcome the deficiency of pure visual techniques, we propose to make use of meta text surrounding images on the Web for enhanced detection accuracy. In this paper we present a multimodal learning algorithm to integrate text information into visual knowledge extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a system that takes raw webpages as input, and automatically extracts visual knowledge (e.g. object bounding boxes) from tens of millions of images crawled from the Web. Experimental results based on 46 object categories show that the extraction precision is improved significantly from 73% (with state-of-the-art deep learning programs) to 81%, which is equivalent to a 31% reduction in error rates."
11,Knowledge Transfer for Out-of-Knowledge-Base Entities : A Graph Neural Network Approach,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/250,"Knowledge base completion (KBC) aims to predict missing information in a knowledge base. In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity problem in KBC: how to answer queries concerning test entities not observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting. Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset."
12,Diversifying Personalized Recommendation with User-session Context,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/258,"Recommender systems (RS) have become an integral part of our daily life. However, most current RS often repeatedly recommend items to users with similar profiles. We argue that recommendation should be diversified by leveraging session contexts with personalized user profiles. For this, current session-based RS (SBRS) often assume a rigidly ordered sequence over data which does not fit in many real-world cases. Moreover, personalization is often omitted in current SBRS. Accordingly, a personalized SBRS over relaxedly ordered user-session contexts is more pragmatic. In doing so, deep-structured models tend to be too complex to serve for online SBRS owing to the large number of users and items. Therefore, we design an efficient SBRS with shallow wide-in-wide-out networks, inspired by the successful experience in modern language modelings. The experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods."
13,Semi-supervised Max-margin Topic Model with Manifold Posterior Regularization,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/259,"Supervised topic models leverage label information to learn discriminative latent topic representations. As collecting a fully labeled dataset is often time-consuming, semi-supervised learning is of high interest. In this paper, we present an effective semi-supervised max-margin topic model by naturally introducing manifold posterior regularization to a regularized Bayesian topic model, named LapMedLDA. The model jointly learns latent topics and a related classifier with only a small fraction of labeled documents. To perform the approximate inference, we derive an efficient stochastic gradient MCMC method. Unlike the previous semi-supervised topic models, our model adopts a tight coupling between the generative topic model and the discriminative classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that such tight coupling brings significant benefits in quantitative and qualitative performance."
14,Semi-supervised Learning over Heterogeneous Information Networks by Ensemble of Meta-graph Guided Random Walks,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/270,"Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a general representation of many real world applications. The difference between HIN and traditional homogeneous graphs is that the nodes and edges in HIN are with types. Then in the many applications, we need to consider the types to make the approach more semantically meaningful. For the applications that annotation is expensive, on natural way is to consider semi-supervised learning over HIN. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm constrained by the types of HINs. We first decompose the original HIN into several semantically meaningful sub-graphs based the meta-graphs composed of entity and relation types. Then we perform random walk over the sub-graphs to propagate the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data. After we obtain all the labels propagated by different trials of random walk guided by meta-graphs, we use an ensemble algorithm to vote for the final labeling results. We use two public available datasets, 20-newsgroups and RCV1 datasets to test our algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is better than the traditional semi-supervised learning algorithms for HINs. One particular by-product of this work is that we show that previous random walk approach guided by meta-paths can be non-stationary, which is the major reason we propose a meta-graph guide random walk for semi-supervised learning over HINs."
15,Exploration of Tree-based Hierarchical Softmax for Recurrent Language Models,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/271,"Recently, variants of neural networks for computational linguistics have been proposed and successfully applied to neural language modeling and neural machine translation. These neural models can leverage knowledge from massive corpora but they are extremely slow as they predict candidate words from a large vocabulary during training and inference. As an alternative to gradient approximation and softmax with class decomposition, we explore the tree-based hierarchical softmax method and reform its architecture, making it compatible with modern GPUs and introducing a compact tree-based loss function. When combined with several word hierarchical clustering algorithms, improved performance is achieved in language modelling task with intrinsic evaluation criterions on PTB, WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 datasets."
16,DeepStory: Video Story QA by Deep Embedded Memory Networks,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/280,"Question-answering (QA) on video contents is a significant challenge for achieving human-level intelligence as it involves both vision and language in real-world settings. Here we demonstrate the possibility of an AI agent performing video story QA by learning from a large amount of cartoon videos. We develop a video-story learning model, i.e. Deep Embedded Memory Networks (DEMN), to reconstruct stories from a joint scene-dialogue video stream using a latent embedding space of observed data. The video stories are stored in a long-term memory component. For a given question, an LSTM-based attention model uses the long-term memory to recall the best question-story-answer triplet by focusing on specific words containing key information. We trained the DEMN on a novel QA dataset of children’s cartoon video series, Pororo. The dataset contains 16,066 scene-dialogue pairs of 20.5-hour videos, 27,328 fine-grained sentences for scene description, and 8,913 story-related QA pairs. Our experimental results show that the DEMN outperforms other QA models. This is mainly due to 1) the reconstruction of video stories in a scene-dialogue combined form that utilize the latent embedding and 2) attention. DEMN also achieved state-of-the-art results on the MovieQA benchmark."
17,Earth Mover's Distance Pooling over Siamese LSTMs for Automatic Short Answer Grading,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/284,"Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) can reduce tedium for instructors, but is complicated by free-form student inputs. An important ASAG task is to assign  ordinal scores to student answers, given some “model” or ideal answers. Here we introduce a novel framework for ASAG by cascading three neural building blocks: Siamese bidirectional LSTMs applied to a model and a student answer, a novel pooling layer based on earth-mover distance (EMD) across all hidden states from  both LSTMs, and a flexible final regression layer to output scores. On standard ASAG data sets, our system shows substantial reduction in grade estimation error compared to competitive baselines. We demonstrate that EMD pooling results in substantial accuracy gains, and that a support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) output layer helps outperform softmax. Our system also outperforms recent attention mechanisms on LSTM states."
18,Effective Representing of Information Network by Variational Autoencoder,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/292,"Network representation is the basis of many applications and of extensive interest in various fields, such as information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Most previous methods for network representation only consider the incomplete aspects of a problem, including link structure, node information, and partial integration. The present study proposes a deep network representation model that seamlessly integrates the text information and structure of a network. Our model captures highly non-linear relationships between nodes and complex features of a network by exploiting the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a deep unsupervised generation algorithm. We also merge the representation learned with a paragraph vector model and that learned with the VAE to obtain the network representation that preserves both structure and text information. We conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on benchmark datasets and find our model performs better than state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin."
19,Self-paced Compensatory Deep Boltzmann Machine for Semi-Structured Document Embedding,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/304,"In the last decade, there has been a huge amount of documents with different types of rich metadata information, which belongs to the Semi-Structured Documents (SSDs), appearing in many real applications. It is an interesting research work to model this type of text data following the way how humans understand text with informative metadata. In the paper, we introduce a Self-paced Compensatory Deep Boltzmann Machine (SCDBM) architecture that learns a deep neural network by using metadata information to learn deep structure layer-wisely for Semi-Structured Documents (SSDs) embedding in a self-paced way. Inspired by the way how humans understand text, the model defines a deep process of document vector extraction beyond the space of words by jointing the metadata where each layer selects different types of metadata. We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for the SCDBM model and empirically demonstrate that using the representation discovered by this model has better performance on semi-structured document classification and retrieval,  and tag prediction comparing with state-of-the-art baselines."
20,End-to-End Adversarial Memory Network for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/311,"Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification have raised much attention in recent years. Due to the domain discrepancy, a sentiment classifier trained in a source domain may not work well when directly applied to a target domain. Traditional methods need to manually select pivots, which behave in the same way for discriminative learning in both domains. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a representation shared by domains. However, they lack the interpretability to directly identify the pivots. To address the problem, we introduce an end-to-end Adversarial Memory Network (AMN) for cross-domain sentiment classification. Unlike existing methods, our approach can automatically capture the pivots using an attention mechanism. Our framework consists of two parameter-shared memory networks: one is for sentiment classification and the other is for domain classification. The two networks are jointly trained so that the selected features minimize the sentiment classification error and at the same time make the domain classifier indiscriminative between the representations from the source or target domains. Moreover, unlike deep learning methods that cannot tell us which words are the pivots, our approach can offer a direct visualization of them. Experiments on the Amazon review dataset demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods."
21,Completely Heterogeneous Transfer Learning with Attention - What And What Not To Transfer,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/349,"We study a transfer learning framework where source and target datasets are heterogeneous in both feature and label spaces. Specifically, we do not assume explicit relations between source and target tasks a priori, and thus it is crucial to determine what and what not to transfer from source knowledge. Towards this goal, we define a new heterogeneous transfer learning approach that (1) selects and attends to an optimized subset of source samples to transfer knowledge from, and (2) builds a unified transfer network that learns from both source and target knowledge. This method, termed ""Attentional Heterogeneous Transfer"", along with a newly proposed unsupervised transfer loss, improve upon the previous state-of-the-art approaches on extensive simulations as well as a challenging hetero-lingual text classification task."
22,Stacking With Auxiliary Features,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/367,"Ensembling methods are well known for improving prediction accuracy. However, they are limited in the sense that they cannot effectively discriminate among component models. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features that learns to fuse additional relevant information from multiple component systems as well as input instances to improve performance. We use two types of auxiliary features -- instance features and provenance features. The instance features enable the stacker to discriminate across input instances and the provenance features enable the stacker to discriminate across component systems. When combined together, our algorithm learns to rely on systems that not just agree on an output but also the provenance of this output in conjunction with the properties of the input instance. We demonstrate the success of our approach on three very different and challenging natural language and vision problems: Slot Filling, Entity Discovery and Linking, and ImageNet Object Detection. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on the first two tasks and significant improvements on the ImageNet task, thus verifying the power and generality of our approach."
23,Compressed Nonparametric Language Modelling,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/376,"Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process priors are compelling for learning language models, outperforming point-estimate based methods. However, these models remain unpopular due to computational and statistical inference issues, such as memory and time usage, as well as poor mixing of sampler. In this work we propose a novel framework which represents the HPYP model compactly using compressed suffix trees. Then, we develop an efficient approximate inference scheme in this framework that has a much lower memory footprint compared to full HPYP and is fast in the inference time. The experimental results illustrate that our model can be built on significantly larger datasets compared to previous HPYP models, while being several orders of magnitudes smaller, fast for training and inference, and outperforming the perplexity of the state-of-the-art Modified Kneser-Ney count-based LM smoothing by up to 15%."
24,Hierarchical LSTM with Adjusted Temporal Attention for Video Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/381,"Recent progress has been made in using attention based encoder-decoder framework for video captioning. However, most existing decoders apply the attention mechanism to every generated words including both visual words (e.g., “gun” and ""shooting“) and non-visual words (e.g. ""the“, ""a”).However, these non-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without considering visual signals or attention.Imposing attention mechanism on non-visual words could mislead and decrease the overall performance of video captioning.To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical LSTM with adjusted temporal attention (hLSTMat) approach for video captioning. Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes the temporal attention for selecting specific frames to predict related words, while the adjusted temporal attention is for deciding whether to depend on the visual information or the language context information. Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously consider both low-level visual information and deep semantic information to support the video caption generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we test our method on two prevalent datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT, and experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both two datasets."
25,Recommendation vs Sentiment Analysis: A Text-Driven Latent Factor Model for Rating Prediction with Cold-Start Awareness,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/382,"Review rating prediction is an important research topic. The problem was approached from either the perspective of recommender systems (RS) or that of sentiment analysis (SA).  Recent SA research using deep neural networks (DNNs) has realized the importance of user and product interaction for better interpreting the sentiment of reviews. However, the complexity of DNN models in terms of the scale of parameters is very high, and the performance is not always satisfying especially when user-product interaction is sparse. In this paper, we propose a simple, extensible RS-based model, called Text-driven Latent Factor Model (TLFM), to capture the semantics of reviews, user preferences and product characteristics by jointly optimizing two components, a user-specific LFM and a product-specific LFM, each of which decomposes text into a specific low-dimension representation. Furthermore, we address the cold-start issue by developing a novel Pairwise Rating Comparison strategy (PRC), which utilizes the difference between ratings on common user/product as supplementary information to calibrate parameter estimation. Experiments conducted on IMDB and Yelp datasets validate the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art baseline methods."
26,End-to-end optimization of goal-driven and visually grounded dialogue systems,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/385,"End-to-end design of dialogue systems has recently become a popular research topic thanks to powerful tools such as encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning. Yet, most current approaches cast human-machine dialogue management as a supervised learning problem, aiming at predicting the next utterance of a participant given the full history of the dialogue. This vision may fail to correctly render the planning problem inherent to dialogue as well as its contextual and grounded nature. In this paper, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning method to optimize visually grounded task-oriented dialogues, based on the policy gradient algorithm. This approach is tested on the question generation task from the dataset GuessWhat?! containing 120k dialogues and provides encouraging results at solving both the problem of generating natural dialogues and the task of discovering a specific object in a complex picture."
27,Active Learning for Black-Box Semantic Role Labeling with Neural Factors,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/405,"Active learning is a useful technique for tasks for which unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive. One example of such a task is semantic role labeling (SRL), which relies heavily on labels from trained linguistic experts. One challenge in applying active learning algorithms for SRL is that the complete knowledge of the SRL model is often unavailable, against the common assumption that active learning methods are aware of the details of the underlying models. In this paper, we present an active learning framework for black-box SRL models (i.e., models whose details are unknown). In lieu of a query strategy based on model details, we propose a neural query strategy model that embeds both language and semantic information to automatically learn the query strategy from predictions of an SRL model alone. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both this new active learning framework and the neural query strategy model."
28,Combining Knowledge with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Short Text Classification,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/406,"Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP applications. Most existing work relied on either explicit or implicit text representation to address this problem. While these techniques work well for sentences, they can not easily be applied to short text because of its shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a framework based on convolutional neural networks that combines explicit and implicit representations of short text for classification. We first conceptualize a short text as a set of relevant concepts using a large taxonomy knowledge base. We then obtain the embedding of short text by coalescing the words and relevant concepts on top of pre-trained word vectors. We further incorporate character level features into our model to capture fine-grained subword information. Experimental results on five commonly used datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

Our model, Deep Context Vector, takes advantage of distributed representations to exploit the word order in document sentences, as well as the semantic connections among linked documents in a document network. We evaluate our model on large-scale data collections that include Wikipedia pages, and scientific and legal citations networks. We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency on document classification and link prediction tasks."
30,Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/438,"Entity images could provide significant visual information for knowledge representation learning. Most conventional methods learn knowledge representations merely from structured triples, ignoring rich visual information extracted from entity images. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning model (IKRL), where knowledge representations are learned with both triple facts and images. More specifically, we first construct representations for all images of an entity with a neural image encoder. These image representations are then integrated into an aggregated image-based representation via an attention-based method. We evaluate our IKRL models on knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our models outperform all baselines on both tasks, which indicates the significance of visual information for knowledge representations and the capability of our models in learning knowledge representations with images."
31,Deep Matrix Factorization Models for Recommender Systems,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/447,"Recommender systems usually make personalized recommendation with user-item interaction ratings, implicit feedback and auxiliary information.  Matrix factorization is the basic idea to predict a personalized ranking over a set of items for an individual user with the similarities among users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model with neural network architecture. Firstly, we construct a user-item matrix with explicit ratings and non-preference implicit feedback. With this matrix as the input, we present a deep structure learning architecture to learn a common low dimensional space for the representations of users and items.  Secondly, we design a new loss function based on binary cross entropy, in which we consider both explicit ratings and implicit feedback for a better optimization.  The experimental results show the effectiveness of both our proposed model and the loss function. On several benchmark datasets, our model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance within different experimental settings."
32,A Deep Neural Network for Chinese Zero Pronoun Resolution,Main,"['Discourse', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/464,"Existing approaches for Chinese zero pronoun resolution overlook semantic information. This is because zero pronouns have no descriptive information, which results in difficulty in explicitly capturing their semantic similarities with antecedents. Moreover, when dealing with candidate antecedents, traditional systems simply take advantage of the local information of a single candidate antecedent while failing to consider the underlying information provided by the other candidates from a global perspective. To address these weaknesses, we propose a novel zero pronoun-specific neural network, which is capable of representing zero pronouns by utilizing the contextual information at the semantic level. In addition, when dealing with candidate antecedents, a two-level candidate encoder is employed to explicitly capture both the local and global information of candidate antecedents. We conduct experiments on the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus. Experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art method in various experimental settings."
33,Learning Co-Substructures by Kernel Dependence Maximization,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/465,"Modeling associations between items in a dataset is a problem that is frequently encountered in data and knowledge mining research. Most previous studies have simply applied a predefined fixed pattern for extracting the substructure of each item pair and then analyzed the associations between these substructures. Using such fixed patterns may not, however, capture the significant association. We, therefore, propose the novel machine learning task of extracting a strongly associated substructure pair (co-substructure) from each input item pair. We call this task dependent co-substructure extraction (DCSE), and formalize it as a dependence maximization problem. Then, we discuss critical issues with this task: the data sparsity problem and a huge search space. To address the data sparsity problem, we adopt the Hilbert--Schmidt independence criterion as an objective function. To improve search efficiency, we adopt the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. We report the results of empirical evaluations, in which the proposed method is applied for acquiring and predicting narrative event pairs, an active task in the field of natural language processing."
34,A Generalized Recurrent Neural Architecture for Text Classification with Multi-Task Learning,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/473,"Multi-task learning leverages potential correlations among related tasks to extract common features and yield performance gains. However, most previous works only consider simple or weak interactions, thereby failing to model complex correlations among three or more tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning architecture with four types of recurrent neural layers to fuse information across multiple related tasks. The architecture is structurally flexible and considers various interactions among tasks, which can be regarded as a generalized case of many previous works. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets for text classification show that our model can significantly improve performances of related tasks with additional information from others."
35,ME-MD: An Effective Framework for Neural Machine Translation with Multiple Encoders and Decoders,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/474,"The encoder-decoder neural framework is widely employed for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with a single encoder to represent the source sentence and a single decoder to generate target words. The translation performance heavily relies on the representation ability of the encoder and the generation ability of the decoder. To further enhance NMT, we propose to extend the original encoder-decoder framework to a novel one, which has multiple encoders and decoders (ME-MD). Through this way, multiple encoders extract more diverse features to represent the source sequence and multiple decoders capture more complicated translation knowledge. Our proposed ME-MD framework is convenient to integrate heterogeneous encoders and decoders with multiple depths and multiple types. Experiment on Chinese-English translation task shows that our ME-MD system surpasses the state-of-the-art NMT system by 2.1 BLEU points and surpasses the phrase-based Moses by 7.38 BLEU points. Our framework is general and can be applied to other sequence to sequence tasks."
36,TUCH: Turning Cross-view Hashing into Single-view Hashing via Generative Adversarial Nets,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/491,"Cross-view retrieval, which focuses on searching images as response to text queries or vice versa, has received increasing attention recently. Cross-view hashing is to efficiently solve the cross-view retrieval problem with binary hash codes. Most existing works on cross-view hashing exploit multi-view embedding method to tackle this problem, which inevitably causes the information loss in both image and text domains. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), this paper presents a new model that is able to Turn Cross-view Hashing into single-view hashing (TUCH), thus enabling the information of image to be preserved as much as possible. TUCH is a novel deep architecture that integrates a language model network T for text feature extraction, a generator network G to generate fake images from text feature and a hashing network H for learning hashing functions to generate compact binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint generative adversarial learning and cross-view hashing. Extensive empirical evidence shows that our TUCH approach achieves state-of-the-art results, especially on text to image retrieval, based on image-sentences datasets, i.e. standard IAPRTC-12 and large-scale Microsoft COCO."

However, the existing visual question answering works only focus on the static image, which may be ineffectively applied to video question answering due to the temporal dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we consider the problem of open-ended video question answering from the viewpoint of spatio-temporal attentional encoder-decoder learning framework. We propose the hierarchical spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents according to the given question. We then develop the encoder-decoder learning method with reasoning recurrent neural networks for open-ended video question answering. We construct a large-scale video question answering dataset. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method."

Currently, most of the existing approaches learn the user sentiment model from their posted tweets in microblogs, which suffer from the insufﬁciency of discriminative tweet representation. In this paper, we consider the problem of microblog sentiment classiﬁcation from the viewpoint of heterogeneous MSC network embedding. We propose a novel recurrent random walk network learning framework for the problem by exploiting both users’ posted tweets and their social relations in microblogs. We then introduce the deep recurrent neural networks with random-walk layer for heterogeneous MSC network embedding, which can be trained end-to-end from the scratch. Weemploytheback-propagationmethodfortraining the proposed recurrent random walk network model.

39,Opinion-aware Knowledge Graph for Political Ideology Detection,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/510,"Identifying individual's political ideology from their speeches and written texts is important for analyzing political opinions and user behavior on social media. Traditional opinion mining methods rely on bag-of-words representations to classify texts into different ideology categories. Such methods are too coarse for understanding political ideologies. The key to identify different ideologies is to recognize different opinions expressed toward a specific topic. To model this insight, we classify ideologies based on the distribution of opinions expressed towards real-world entities or topics. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to political ideology detection that makes predictions based on an opinion-aware knowledge graph. We show how to construct such graph by integrating the opinions and targeted entities extracted from text into an existing structured knowledge base, and show how to perform ideology inference by information propagation on the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in detecting ideologies compared to baselines including LR, SVM and RNN."

In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring diagnostic decision-making via modeling physicians' utterances of medical concepts during image-based diagnoses. We conduct experiments to collect verbal narratives from dermatologists while they are examining and describing dermatology images towards diagnoses. We propose a hierarchical probabilistic framework to learn domain-specific patterns from the medical concepts in these narratives. The discovered patterns match the diagnostic units of thought identified by domain experts. These meaningful patterns uncover physicians' diagnostic decision-making processes while parsing the image content. Our evaluation shows that these patterns provide key information to classify narratives by diagnostic correctness levels."

Recent advancement in Deep Learning has sparked an interest in the use of neural networks in modeling language, particularly for personalized conversational agents that can retain contextual information during dialog exchanges. This work carefully explores and compares several of the recently proposed neural conversation models, and carries out a detailed evaluation on the multiple factors that can significantly affect predictive performance, such as pretraining, embedding training, data cleaning, diversity reranking, evaluation setting, etc. Based on the tradeoffs of different models, we propose a new generative dialogue model conditioned on speakers as well as context history that outperforms all previous models on both retrieval and generative metrics. Our findings indicate that pretraining speaker embeddings on larger datasets, as well as bootstrapping word and speaker embeddings, can significantly improve performance (up to 3 points in perplexity), and that promoting diversity in using Mutual Information based techniques has a very strong effect in ranking metrics."
42,How to Keep a Knowledge Base Synchronized with Its Encyclopedia Source,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/524,"Knowledge bases are playing an increasingly important role in many real-world applications. However, most of these knowledge bases tend to be outdated, which limits the utility of these knowledge bases. In this paper, we investigate how to keep the freshness of the knowledge base by synchronizing it with its data source (usually encyclopedia websites). A direct solution is revisiting the whole encyclopedia periodically and rerun the entire pipeline of the construction of knowledge base like most existing methods. However, this solution is wasteful and incurs massive overload of the network, which limits the update frequency and leads to knowledge obsolescence. To overcome the weakness, we propose a set of synchronization principles upon which we build an Update System for knowledge Base (USB) with an update frequency predictor of entities as the core component.  We also design a set of effective features and realize the predictor.  We conduct extensive experiments to justify the effectiveness of the proposed system, model, as well as the underlying principles. Finally, we deploy USB on a Chinese knowledge base to improve its freshness."
43,Cognitive-Inspired Conversational-Strategy Reasoner for Socially-Aware Agents,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/532,"In this work we propose a novel module for a dialogue system that allows a conversational agent to utter phrases that do not just meet the system's task intentions, but also work towards achieving the system's social intentions. The module  - a Social Reasoner - takes the task goals the system must achieve and decides the appropriate conversational style and strategy with which the dialogue system describes the information the user desires so as to boost the strength of the relationship between the user and system (rapport), and therefore the user's engagement and willingness to divulge the information the agent needs to efficiently and effectively achieve the user's goals. Our Social Reasoner is inspired both by analysis of empirical data of friends and stranger dyads engaged in a task, and by prior literature in fields as diverse as reasoning processes in cognitive and social psychology, decision-making, sociolinguistics and conversational analysis. Our experiments demonstrated that, when using the Social Reasoner in a Dialogue System, the rapport level between the user and system increases in more than 35% in comparison with those cases where no Social Reasoner is used."
44,Predicting the Quality of Short Narratives from Social Media,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/539,"An important and difficult challenge in building computational models for narratives is the automatic evaluation of narrative quality. Quality evaluation connects narrative understanding and generation as generation systems need to evaluate their own products. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we employ upvotes in social media as an approximate measure for story quality. We collected 54,484 answers from a crowd-powered question-and-answer website, Quora, and then used active learning to build a classifier that labeled 28,320 answers as stories. To predict the number of upvotes without the use of social network features, we create neural networks that model textual regions and the interdependence among regions, which serve as strong benchmarks for future research. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study for automatic evaluation of narrative quality."

On social media, each user’s language use can be significantly affected by the user’s friends. In this paper, we propose a socialized word embedding algorithm which can consider both user’s personal characteristics of language use and the user’s social relationship on social media. To incorporate personal characteristics, we propose to use a user vector to represent each user. Then for each user, the word embeddings are trained based on each user’s corpus by combining the global word vectors and local user vector. To incorporate social relationship, we add a regularization term to impose similarity between two friends. In this way, we can train the global word vectors and user vectors jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we used the latest large-scale Yelp data to train our vectors, and designed several experiments to show how user vectors affect the results."

However, the previous neural models cannot extract the complicated feature compositions as the traditional methods with discrete features. In this work, we propose a feature-enriched neural model for joint Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging task. Specifically, to simulate the feature templates of traditional discrete feature based models, we use different filters to model the complex compositional features with convolutional and pooling layer, and then utilize long distance dependency information with recurrent layer. Experimental results on five different datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model."
47,Multimodal Storytelling via Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,Main,['Natural Language Summarization'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/554,"Deriving event storylines is an effective summarization method to succinctly organize extensive information, which can significantly alleviate the pain of information overload. The critical challenge is the lack of widely recognized definition of storyline metric. Prior studies have developed various approaches based on different assumptions about users' interests. These works can extract interesting patterns, but their assumptions do not guarantee that the derived patterns will match users' preference. On the other hand, their exclusiveness of single modality source misses cross-modality information. This paper proposes a method, multimodal imitation learning via Generative Adversarial Networks(MIL-GAN), to directly model users' interests as reflected by various data. In particular, the proposed model addresses the critical challenge by imitating users' demonstrated storylines. Our proposed model is designed to learn the reward patterns given user-provided storylines and then applies the learned policy to unseen data. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be capable of acquiring the user's implicit intent and outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin with a user study."
48,Joint Training for Pivot-based Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/555,"While recent neural machine translation approaches have delivered state-of-the-art performance for resource-rich language pairs, they suffer from the data scarcity problem for resource-scarce language pairs. Although this problem can be alleviated by exploiting a pivot language to bridge the source and target languages, the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models are usually independently trained. In this work, we introduce a joint training algorithm for pivot-based neural machine translation. We propose three methods to connect the two models and enable them to interact with each other during training. Experiments on Europarl and WMT corpora show that joint training of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models leads to significant improvements over independent training across various languages."

In this paper, we develop a two-step end-to-end fully automated approach for solving such questions that is able to automatically provide answers to exercises about probability formulated in natural language.In the first step, a question formulated in natural language is analysed and transformed into a high-level model specified in a declarative language. In the second step, a solution to the high-level model is computed using a probabilistic programming system. On a dataset of 2160 probability problems,  our solver is able to correctly answer 97.5% of the questions given a correct model.  On the end-to-end evaluation, we are able to answer 12.5% of the questions (or 31.1% if we exclude examples not supported by design)."
50,Stance Classification with Target-specific Neural Attention,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/557,"Stance classification, which aims at detecting the stance expressed in text towards a specific target, is an emerging problem in sentiment analysis. A major difference between stance classification and traditional aspect-level sentiment classification is that the identification of stance is dependent on target which might not be explicitly mentioned in text. This indicates that apart from text content, the target information is important to stance detection. To this end, we propose a neural network-based model, which incorporates target-specific information into stance classification by following a novel attention mechanism. In specific, the attention mechanism is expected to locate the critical parts of text which are related to target. Our evaluations on both the English and Chinese Stance Detection datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance."

Previous approaches to this task typically make use of candidate region proposals, where end performance depends on that of the region proposal method and additional computational costs are incurred. In this paper, we treat grounding as a regression problem and propose a method to directly identify the region referred to by a textual phrase, eliminating the need for external candidate region prediction. Our approach uses deep neural networks to combine image and text representations and refines the target region with attention models over both image subregions and words in the textual phrase. Despite the challenging nature of this task and sparsity of available data, in evaluation on the ReferIt dataset, our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in performance of 37.26% accuracy, surpassing the previously reported best by over 5 percentage points. We find that combining image and text attention models and an image attention area-sensitive loss function contribute to substantial improvements."

The main contributions are: the approach itself, a formal quantitative measure of language diversity; a set of formal quantitative measures of resource incompleteness and a large scale resource, called the Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) built following the methodology proposed. As a concrete example of an application, we provide an algorithm for distinguishing polysemes from homonyms, as stored in the UKC."
54,Learning to Explain Entity Relationships by Pairwise Ranking with Convolutional Neural Networks,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/561,"Providing a plausible explanation for the relationship between two related entities is an important task in some applications of knowledge graphs, such as in search engines. However, most existing methods require a large number of manually labeled training data, which cannot be applied in large-scale knowledge graphs due to the expensive data annotation. In addition, these methods typically rely on costly handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose an effective pairwise ranking model by leveraging clickthrough data of a Web search engine to address these two problems. We first construct large-scale training data by leveraging the query-title pairs derived from clickthrough data of a Web search engine. Then, we build a pairwise ranking model which employs a convolutional neural network to automatically learn relevant features. The proposed model can be easily trained with backpropagation to perform the ranking task. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms several strong baselines."

56,MAT: A Multimodal Attentive Translator for Image Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/563,"In this work we formulate the problem of image captioning as a multimodal translation task. Analogous to machine translation, we present a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model for image caption generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to represent the input image as a sequence of detected objects which feeds as the source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential representation of an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target sequence of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we extract the objects features in the image and arrange them in a order using convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the visual information from the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectively attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS COCO, and the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dataset splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the evaluation server of MS COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1.064 (c40)."

Utilizing artificially picked and labeled external sources is an effective way to enhance the performance of MED. However, building these data usually requires professional human annotators, and the procedure is too time-consuming and costly to scale. In this paper, we propose a new robust dictionary learning framework for complex event detection, which is able to handle both labeled and easy-to-get unlabeled web videos by sharing the same dictionary. By employing the lq-norm based loss jointly with the structured sparsity based regularization, our model shows strong robustness against the substantial noisy and outlier videos from open source. We exploit an effective optimization algorithm to solve the proposed highly non-smooth and non-convex problem. Extensive experiment results over standard datasets of TRECVID MEDTest 2013 and TRECVID MEDTest 2014 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework on complex event detection."

With the observations that significant triangular connectivity structures and parallelogram connectivity structures found in many real multi-relational networks are often ignored and that a hard-constraint commonly adopted by most of the network embedding methods is inaccurate by design, we propose a novel representation learning model for multi-relational networks which can alleviate both fundamental limitations. Scalable learning algorithms are derived using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and negative sampling. Extensive experiments on real multi-relational network datasets of WordNet and Freebase demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model when compared with the state-of-the-art embedding methods."

In spite of their success, most existing models suffer from the underfitting problem: they recursively use the same shared compositional function throughout the whole compositional process and lack expressive power due to inability to capture the richness of compositionality.In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the dynamic compositional neural networks over tree structure (DC-TreeNN), in which the compositional function is dynamically generated by a meta network.The role of meta-network is to capture the metaknowledge across the different compositional rules and formulate them. Experimental results on two typical tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed models."

Most of the existing methods are based on neural network, which recursively apply different composition functions to a sequence of word vectors thereby obtaining a sentence vector.A hypothesis behind these approaches is that the meaning of any phrase can be composed of the meanings of its constituents.However, many phrases, such as idioms, are apparently non-compositional.To address this problem, we introduce a parameterized compositional switch, which outputs a scalar to adaptively determine whether the meaning of a phrase should be composed of its two constituents.We evaluate our model on five datasets of sentiment classification and demonstrate its efficacy with qualitative and quantitative experimental analysis ."

Previous approaches have realized the importance of targets in sentiment classification and developed various methods with the goal of precisely modeling thier contexts via generating  target-specific representations. However, these studies always ignore the separate modeling of targets. In this paper, we argue that both targets and contexts deserve special treatment and need to be learned their own representations via interactive learning. Then, we propose the  interactive attention networks (IAN) to interactively learn attentions in the contexts and targets, and generate the representations for targets and contexts separately. With this design, the IAN model can well represent a target and its collocative context, which is helpful to sentiment classification. Experimental results on SemEval 2014 Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."

However, most previous methods are limited to document-aligned data. In this paper, we try to address two challenges of applying topic models to lexicon extraction in non-parallel data: 1) hard to model the word relationship and 2) noisy seed dictionary. To solve these two challenges, we propose two new bilingual topic models to better capture the semantic information of each word while discriminating the multiple translations in a noisy seed dictionary. We extend the scope of topic models by inverting the roles of ""word"" and ""document"". In addition, to solve the problem of noise in seed dictionary, we incorporate the probability of translation selection in our models. Moreover, we also propose an effective measure to evaluate the similarity of words in different languages and select the optimal translation pairs. Experimental results using real world data demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the proposed models."

Oftentimes, however, it is equally important to understand why an argument is unpersuasive, as it is difficult for an author to make her argument more persuasive unless she first knows what errors made it unpersuasive. Motivated by this practical concern, we (1) annotate a corpus of debate comments with not only their persuasiveness scores but also the errors they contain, (2) propose an approach to persuasiveness scoring and error identification that outperforms competing baselines, and (3) show that the persuasiveness scores computed by our approach can indeed be explained by the errors it identifies."

Most existing methods for semantic parsing are based on understanding the semantics of a single sentence at a time. However, understanding conversations also requires an understanding of conversational context and discourse structure across sentences. We formulate semantic parsing of conversations as a structured prediction task, incorporating structural features that model the `flow of discourse' across sequences of utterances. We create a dataset for semantic parsing of conversations, consisting of 113 real-life sequences of interactions of human users with an automated email assistant. The data contains 4759 natural language statements paired with annotated logical forms.  Our approach yields significant gains in performance over traditional semantic parsing."

To address this problem, we first define the sentence complexity assessment as a five-level classification task, and build a ‘gold standard’ dataset. Next, we propose robust systems for sentence complexity assessment, using a novel set of features based on leveraging lexical properties of freely available corpora, and investigate the impact of the feature type and corpus size on the classification performance."

Previous proposals for the task are essentially general solutions taking the form of neural networks that measure semantic similarity.  In contrast, the present paper describes a simple technique to take advantage of such general-purpose tools for dealing with questions and answer sentences without changing the base system. The technique involves replacing wh-words in input questions with a word denoting the prototype of all answers.  These transformed questions are passed as input to an existing neural network built for measuring semantic similarity. This technique is evaluated on two different neural network architectures over two datasets: TrecQA and WikiQA. Results of our experiments show improvement in overall accuracy across most question types we are interested in: `who', `when' and `where'-type questions."

Recent success of neural sentence summarization models shows the capacity of generating informative, fluent headlines conditioned on selected recapitulative sentences. In this paper, we investigate the extension of sentence summarization models to the document headline generation task. The challenge is that extending the sentence summarization model to consider more document information will mostly confuse the model and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine approach, which first identifies the important sentences of a document using document summarization techniques, and then exploits a multi-sentence summarization model with hierarchical attention to leverage the important sentences for headline generation. Experimental results on a large real dataset demonstrate the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of neural sentence summarization models on the headline generation task."

We combine these tasks, first inducing word senses and then detecting similar senses to form word-sense synonym sets (synsets) in an unsupervised fashion. Given pairs of images and text with noun phrase labels, we perform synset induction to produce collections of underlying concepts described by one or more noun phrases. We find that considering multi-modal features from both visual and textual context yields better induced synsets than using either context alone. Human evaluations show that our unsupervised, multi-modally induced synsets are comparable in quality to annotation-assisted ImageNet synsets, achieving about 84% of ImageNet synsets' approval."
69,Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Commonsense Machine Comprehension,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/576,"Recently proposed Story Cloze Test [Mostafazadeh et al., 2016] is a commonsense machine comprehension application to deal with natural language understanding problem. This dataset contains a lot of story tests which require commonsense inference ability. Unfortunately, the training data is almost unsupervised where each context document followed with only one positive sentence that can be inferred from the context. However, in the testing period, we must make inference from two candidate sentences. To tackle this problem, we employ the generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate fake sentence. We proposed a Conditional GANs in which the generator is conditioned by the context. Our experiments show the advantage of the CGANs in discriminating sentence and achieve state-of-the-art results in commonsense story reading comprehension task compared with previous feature engineering and deep learning methods."
70,Joint Learning on Relevant User Attributes in Micro-blog,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/577,"User attribute classification aims to identify users’ attributes (e.g., gender, age and profession) by leveraging user generated content. However, conventional approaches to user attribute classification focus on single attribute classification involving only one user attribute, which completely ignores the relationship among various user attributes. In this paper, we confront a novel scenario in user attribute classification where relevant user attributes are jointly learned, attempting to make the relevant attribute classification tasks help each other. Specifically, we propose a joint learning approach, namely Aux-LSTM, which first learns a proper auxiliary representation between the related tasks and then leverages the auxiliary representation to integrate the learning process in both tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach to joint learning on relevant user attributes."
71,Learning Sentence Representation with Guidance of Human Attention,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/578,"Recently, much progress has been made in learning general-purpose sentence representations that can be used across domains. However, most of the existing models typically treat each word in a sentence equally. In contrast, extensive studies have proven that human read sentences efficiently by making a sequence of fixation and saccades. This motivates us to improve sentence representations by assigning different weights to the vectors of the component words, which can be treated as an attention mechanism on single sentences. To that end, we propose two novel attention models, in which the attention weights are derived using significant predictors of human reading time, i.e., Surprisal, POS tags and CCG supertags. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art sentence representation models."
72,Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences,Main,"['Information Retrieval', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/579,"Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety of tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or only apply single granular (word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model. Given two sentences P and Q, our model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two encoded sentences in two directions P against Q and P against Q. In each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all time-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, a decision is made through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks: paraphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks."
73,DDoS Event Forecasting using Twitter Data,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/580,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been significant threats to the Internet. Traditional research in cyber security focuses on detecting emerging DDoS attacks by tracing network package flow. A characteristic of DDoS defense is that rescue time is limited since the launch of attack. More resilient detection and defence models are typically more costly. We aim at predicting the likelihood of DDoS attacks by monitoring relevant text streams in social media, so that the level of defense can be adjusted dynamically for maximizing cost-effect. To our knowledge, this is a novel and challenge research question for DDoS rescue. Because the input of this task is a text stream rather than a document, information should be collected both on the textual content of individual posts. We propose a fine-grained hierarchical stream model to capture semantic information over infinitely long history, and reveal burstiness and trends. Empirical evaluation shows that social text streams are indeed informative for DDoS forecasting, and our proposed hierarchical model is more effective compared to strong baseline text stream models and discrete bag-of-words models."
74,A Neural Model for Joint Event Detection and Summarization,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/581,"Twitter new event detection aims to identify first stories in a tweet stream. Typical approaches consider two sub tasks. First, it is necessary to filter out mundane or irrelevant tweets. Second, tweets are grouped automatically into event clusters. Traditionally, these two sub tasks are processed separately, and integrated under a pipeline setting, despite that there is inter-dependence between the two tasks. In addition, one further related task is summarization, which is to extract a succinct summary for representing a large group of tweets. Summarization is related to detection, under the new event setting in that salient information is universal between event representing tweets and informative event summaries. In this paper, we build a joint model to filter, cluster, and summarize the tweets for new events. In particular, deep representation learning is used to vectorize tweets, which serves as basis that connects tasks. A neural stacking model is used for integrating a pipeline of different sub tasks, and for better sharing between the predecessor and successors. Experiments show that our proposed neural joint model is more effective compared to its pipeline baseline."
75,A Variational Autoencoding Approach for Inducing Cross-lingual Word Embeddings,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/582,"Cross-language learning allows one to use training data from one language to build models for another language. Many traditional approaches require word-level alignment sentences from parallel corpora, in this paper we define a general bilingual training objective function requiring sentence level parallel corpus only. We propose a variational autoencoding approach for training bilingual word embeddings. The variational model introduces a continuous latent variable to explicitly model the underlying semantics of the parallel sentence pairs and to guide the generation of the sentence pairs. Our model restricts the bilingual word embeddings to represent words in exactly the same continuous vector space. Empirical results on the task of cross lingual document classification has shown that our method is effective."
76,Learning to Identify Ambiguous and Misleading News Headlines,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/583,"Accuracy is one of the basic principles of journalism. However, it is increasingly hard to manage due to the diversity of news media. Some editors of online news tend to use catchy headlines which trick readers into clicking. These headlines are either ambiguous or misleading, degrading the reading experience of the audience. Thus, identifying inaccurate news headlines is a task worth studying. Previous work names these headlines ``clickbaits'' and mainly focus on the features extracted from the headlines, which limits the performance since the consistency between headlines and news bodies is underappreciated. In this paper, we clearly redefine the problem and identify ambiguous and misleading headlines separately. We utilize class sequential rules to exploit structure information when detecting ambiguous headlines. For the identification of misleading headlines, we extract features based on the congruence between headlines and bodies. To make use of the large unlabeled data set, we apply a co-training method and gain an increase in performance. The experiment results show the effectiveness of our methods. Then we use our classifiers to detect inaccurate headlines crawled from different sources and conduct a data analysis."
77,Improved Neural Machine Translation with Source Syntax,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/584,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture has recently achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Researchers have proven that extending word level attention to phrase level attention by incorporating source-side phrase structure can enhance the attention model and achieve promising improvement. However, word dependencies that can be crucial to correctly understand a source sentence are not always in a consecutive fashion (i.e. phrase structure), sometimes they can be in long distance. Phrase structures are not the best way to explicitly model long distance dependencies. In this paper we propose a simple but effective method to incorporate source-side long distance dependencies into NMT. Our method based on dependency trees enriches each source state with global dependency structures, which can better capture the inherent syntactic structure of source sentences. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-Japanese translation tasks show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines."
78,Symbolic Priors for RNN-based Semantic Parsing,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/585,"Seq2seq models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently received a lot of attention in the domain of Semantic Parsing. While in principle they can be trained directly on pairs (natural language utterances, logical forms), their performance is limited by the amount of available data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit various sources of prior knowledge: the well-formedness of the logical forms is modeled by a weighted context-free grammar; the likelihood that certain entities present in the input utterance are also present in the logical form is modeled by weighted finite-state automata. The grammar and automata are combined together through an efficient intersection algorithm to form a soft guide (“background”) to the RNN.We test our method on an extension of the Overnight dataset and show that it not only strongly improves over an RNN baseline, but also outperforms non-RNN models based on rich sets of hand-crafted features."
79,Fast Parallel Training of Neural Language Models,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/586,"Training neural language models (NLMs) is very time consuming and we need parallelization for system speedup. However, standard training methods have poor scalability across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs) due to the huge time cost required to transmit data for gradient sharing in the back-propagation process. In this paper we present a sampling-based approach to reducing data transmission for better scaling of NLMs. As a ''bonus'', the resulting model also improves the training speed on a single device. Our approach yields significant speed improvements on a recurrent neural network-based language model. On four NVIDIA GTX1080 GPUs, it achieves a speedup of 2.1+ times over the standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent baseline, yet with no increase in perplexity. This is even 4.2 times faster than the naive single GPU counterpart."
80,Lexical Sememe Prediction via Word Embeddings and Matrix Factorization,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/587,"Sememes are defined as the minimum semantic units of human languages. People have manually annotated lexical sememes for words and form linguistic knowledge bases. However, manual construction is time-consuming and labor-intensive, with significant annotation inconsistency and noise. In this paper, we for the first time explore to automatically predict lexical sememes based on semantic meanings of words encoded by word embeddings. Moreover, we apply matrix factorization to learn semantic relations between sememes and words. In experiments, we take a real-world sememe knowledge base HowNet for training and evaluation, and the results reveal the effectiveness of our method for lexical sememe prediction. Our method will be of great use for annotation verification of existing noisy sememe knowledge bases and annotation suggestion of new words and phrases."
81,A Correlated Topic Model Using Word Embeddings,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/588,"Conventional correlated topic models are able to capture correlation structure among latent topics by replacing the Dirichlet prior with the logistic normal distribution. Word embeddings have been proven to be able to capture semantic regularities in language. Therefore, the semantic relatedness and correlations between words can be directly calculated in the word embedding space, for example, via cosine values. In this paper, we propose a novel correlated topic model using word embeddings. The proposed model enables us to exploit the additional word-level correlation information in word embeddings and directly model topic correlation in the continuous word embedding space. In the model, words in documents are replaced with meaningful word embeddings, topics are modeled as multivariate Gaussian distributions over the word embeddings and topic correlations are learned among the continuous Gaussian topics. A Gibbs sampling solution with data augmentation is given to perform inference. We evaluate our model on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the Reuters-21578 dataset qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model."
82,Learning Conversational Systems that Interleave Task and Non-Task Content,Main,"['Dialogue', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/589,"Task-oriented dialog systems have been applied in various tasks, such as automated personal assistants, customer service providers and tutors. These systems work well when users have clear and explicit intentions that are well-aligned to the systems' capabilities. However, they fail if users intentions are not explicit.To address this shortcoming, we propose a framework to interleave non-task content (i.e.everyday social conversation) into task conversations. When the task content fails, the system can still keep the user engaged with the non-task content. We trained a policy using reinforcement learning algorithms to promote  long-turn conversation coherence and consistency, so that the system can have smooth transitions between task and non-task content.To test the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we developed a movie promotion dialog system. Experiments with human users indicate that a system that interleaves social and task content achieves a better task success rate and is also rated as more engaging compared to a pure task-oriented system."
83,AGRA: An Analysis-Generation-Ranking Framework for Automatic Abbreviation from Paper Titles,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/590,"People sometimes choose word-like abbreviations to refer to items with a long description. These abbreviations usually come from the descriptive text of the item and are easy to remember and pronounce, while preserving the key idea of the item. Coming up with a nice abbreviation is not an easy job, even for human. Previous assistant naming systems compose names by applying hand-written rules, which may not perform well. In this paper, we propose to view the naming task as an artificial intelligence problem and create a data set in the domain of academic naming. To generate more delicate names, we propose a three-step framework, including description analysis, candidate generation and abbreviation ranking, each of which is parameterized and optimizable. We conduct experiments to compare different settings of our framework with several analysis approaches from different perspectives. Compared to online or baseline systems, our framework could achieve the best results."

85,Automatic Generation of Grounded Visual Questions,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/592,"In this paper, we propose the first model to be able to generate visually grounded questions with diverse types for a single image. Visual question generation is an emerging topic which aims to ask questions in natural language based on visual input. To the best of our knowledge, it lacks automatic methods to generate meaningful questions with various types for the same visual input. To circumvent the problem, we propose a model that automatically generates visually grounded questions with varying types. Our model takes as input both images and the captions generated by a dense caption model, samples the most probable question types, and generates the questions in sequel. The experimental results on two real world datasets show that our model outperforms the strongest baseline in terms of both correctness and diversity with a wide margin."
86,Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Expanation,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Information Retrieval']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/593,"Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Explanation (ESC) refers to a type of entity acquisition query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtains in return not only some related entities but also concepts which can best explain the query and the result. ESC is useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendation and query expansion. Many example based entity suggestion solutions are available in existing literatures. However, they are generally not aware of the concepts of query entities thus cannot be used for conceptual explanation. In this paper, we propose two probabilistic entity suggestion models and their computation solutions. Our models and solutions fully take advantage of the large scale taxonomies which consist of isA relations between entities and concepts. With our models and solutions, we can not only find the best entities to suggest but also derive the best concepts to explain the suggestion. Extensive evaluations on real data sets justify the accuracy of our models and the efficiency of our solutions."
87,Maximum Expected Likelihood Estimation for Zero-resource Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/594,"While neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress in translating a handful of high-resource language pairs recently, parallel corpora are not always available for many zero-resource language pairs. To deal with this problem, we propose an approach to zero-resource NMT via maximum expected likelihood estimation. The basic idea is to maximize the expectation with respect to a pivot-to-source translation model for the intended source-to-target model on a pivot-target parallel corpus. To approximate the expectation, we propose two methods to connect the pivot-to-source and source-to-target models. Experiments on two zero-resource language pairs show that the proposed approach yields substantial gains over baseline methods. We also observe  that when trained jointly with the source-to-target model, the pivot-to-source translation model also obtains improvements over independent training."

Most existing methods typically rely on external information of entities such as Wikipedia links and require costly manual feature construction to complete alignment. In this paper, we present a novel approach for entity alignment via joint knowledge embeddings. Our method jointly encodes both entities and relations of various KGs into a unified low-dimensional semantic space according to a small seed set of aligned entities. During this process, we can align entities according to their semantic distance in this joint semantic space. More specifically, we present an iterative and parameter sharing method to improve alignment performance. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that, as compared to baselines, our method achieves significant improvements on entity alignment, and can further improve knowledge graph completion performance on various KGs with the favor of joint knowledge embeddings."

Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empiricalexperimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results."

Significant events are reported by different sources and in different languages. In this work, we address the problem of tracking of events in a large multilingual stream. Within a recently developed system Event Registry we examine two aspects of this problem: how to compare articles in different languages and how to link collections of articles in different languages which refer to the same event. Building on previous work, we show there are methods which scale well and can compute a meaningful similarity between articles from languages with little or no direct overlap in the training data.Using this capability, we then propose an approach to link clusters of articles across languages which represent the same event."

It first analyzes and transforms sentences into their meaning-based logical forms, which represent the associated context of each quantity with role-tags (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.). Logic forms with role-tags provide a flexible and simple way to specify the physical meaning of a quantity. Afterwards, the main-goal of the problem is decomposed recursively into its associated sub-goals. For each given sub-goal, the associated operator and operands are selected with statistical  models. Lastly, it performs inference on logic expressions to get the answer and explains how the answer is obtained in a human comprehensible way. This process thus resembles the human cognitive understanding of the problem and produces a more meaningful problem solving interpretation."
