0,Language to Action: Towards Interactive Task Learning with Physical Agents,Invited Speakers,['Natural Language Semantics'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/1,"Language communication plays an important role in human learning and knowledge acquisition. With the emergence of a new generation of cognitive robots, empowering these robots to learn directly from human partners becomes increasingly important. This paper gives a brief introduction to interactive task learning where humans can teach physical agents new tasks through natural language communication and action demonstration. It discusses research challenges and opportunities in language and communication grounding that are critical in this process. It further highlights the importance of commonsense knowledge, particularly the very basic physical causality knowledge, in grounding language to perception and action."
1,Fine-grained Image Classification by  Visual-Semantic Embedding,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/145,"This paper investigates a challenging problem,which is known as fine-grained image classification(FGIC). Different from conventional computer visionproblems, FGIC suffers from the large intraclassdiversities and subtle inter-class differences.Existing FGIC approaches are limited to exploreonly the visual information embedded in the images.In this paper, we present a novel approachwhich can use handy prior knowledge from eitherstructured knowledge bases or unstructured text tofacilitate FGIC. Specifically, we propose a visual-semanticembedding model which explores semanticembedding from knowledge bases and text, andfurther trains a novel end-to-end CNN frameworkto linearly map image features to a rich semanticembedding space. Experimental results on a challenginglarge-scale UCSD Bird-200-2011 datasetverify that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with significant advances."
2,Learning Conceptual Space Representations of Interrelated Concepts,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/243,"Several recently proposed methods aim to learn conceptual space representations from large text collections. These learned representations associate each object from a given domain of interest with a point in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, but they do not model the concepts from this domain, and can thus not directly be used for categorization and related cognitive tasks. A natural solution is to represent concepts as Gaussians, learned from the representations of their instances, but this can only be reliably done if sufficiently many instances are given, which is often not the case. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian model which addresses this problem by constructing informative priors from background knowledge about how the concepts of interest are interrelated with each other. We show that this leads to substantially better predictions in a knowledge base completion task."
3,Time-evolving Text Classification with Deep Neural Networks,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/310,"Traditional text classification algorithms are based on the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed. However, in most non-stationary scenarios, data may change smoothly due to long-term evolution and short-term fluctuation, which raises new challenges to traditional methods. In this paper, we present the first attempt to explore evolutionary neural network models for time-evolving text classification. We first introduce a simple way to extend arbitrary neural networks to evolutionary learning by using a temporal smoothness framework, and then propose a diachronic propagation framework to incorporate the historical impact into currently learned features through diachronic connections. Experiments on real-world news data demonstrate that our approaches greatly and consistently outperform traditional neural network models in both accuracy and stability."
4,Neural Machine Translation with Key-Value Memory-Augmented Attention,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/357,"Although attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, it still suffers from issues of repeating and dropping translations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel key-value memory-augmented attention model for NMT, called KVMEMATT. Specifically, we maintain a timely updated keymemory to keep track of attention history and a fixed value-memory to store the representation of source sentence throughout the whole translation process. Via nontrivial transformations and iterative interactions between the two memories, the decoder focuses on more appropriate source word(s) for predicting the next target word at each decoding step, therefore can improve the adequacy of translations. Experimental results on Chinese)English and WMT17 German,English translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model."
5,ANRL: Attributed Network Representation Learning via Deep Neural Networks,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/438,"Network representation learning (RL) aims to transform the nodes in a network into low-dimensional vector spaces while preserving the inherent properties of the network. Though network RL has been intensively studied, most existing works focus on either network structure or node attribute information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named ANRL, to incorporate both the network structure and node attribute information in a principled way. Specifically, we propose a neighbor enhancement autoencoder to model the node attribute information, which reconstructs its target neighbors instead of itself. To capture the network structure, attribute-aware skip-gram model is designed based on the attribute encoder to formulate the correlations between each node and its direct or indirect neighbors. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world networks, including two social networks, two citation networks and two user behavior networks. The results empirically show that ANRL can achieve relatively significant gains in node classification and link prediction tasks."
6,Interpretable Recommendation via Attraction Modeling: Learning Multilevel Attractiveness over Multimodal Movie Contents,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/472,"New contents like blogs and online videos are produced in every second in the new media age. We argue that attraction is one of the decisive factors for user selection of new contents. However, collaborative filtering cannot work without user feedback; and the existing content-based recommender systems are ineligible to capture and interpret the attractive points on new contents. Accordingly, we propose attraction modeling to learn and interpret user attractiveness. Specially, we build a multilevel attraction model (MLAM) over the content features -- the story (textual data) and cast members (categorical data) of movies. In particular, we design multilevel personal filters to calculate users' attractiveness on words, sentences and cast members at different levels. The experimental results show the superiority of MLAM over the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a case study is provided to demonstrate the interpretability of MLAM by visualizing user attractiveness on a movie."
7,Hashtag2Vec: Learning Hashtag Representation with Relational Hierarchical Embedding Model,Main,"['Text Classification', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/480,"Hashtags have always been important elements in many social network platforms and micro-blog services. Semantic understanding of hashtags is a critical and fundamental task for many applications on social networks, such as event analysis, theme discovery, information retrieval, etc. However, this task is challenging due to the sparsity, polysemy, and synonymy of hashtags. In this paper, we investigate the problem of hashtag embedding by combining the short text content with the various heterogeneous relations in social networks. Specifically, we first establish a network with hashtags as its nodes. Hierarchically, each of the hashtag nodes is associated with a set of tweets and each tweet contains a set of words. Then we devise an embedding model, called Hashtag2Vec, which exploits multiple relations of hashtag-hashtag, hashtag-tweet, tweet-word, and word-word relations based on the hierarchical heterogeneous network. In addition to embedding the hashtags, our proposed framework is capable of embedding the short social texts as well. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
8,A Social Interaction Activity based Time-Varying User Vectorization Method for Online Social Networks,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/527,"In this paper, we consider the problem of user modeling in online social networks, and propose a social interaction activity based user vectorization framework, called the time-varying user vectorization (Tuv), to infer and make use of important user features. Tuv is designed based on a novel combination of word2vec, negative sampling and a smoothing technique for model training. It jointly handles multi-format user data and computes user representing vectors, by taking into consideration user feature variation, self-similarity and pairwise interactions among users. The framework enables us to extract hidden user properties and to produce user vectors. We conduct extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset, which show that Tuv significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art user vectorization methods."
9,Weakly Learning to Match Experts in Online Community,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/534,"In online question-and-answer (QA) websites like Quora, one central issue is to find (invite) users who are able to provide answers to a given question and at the same time would be unlikely to say ""no"" to the invitation. The challenge is how to trade off the matching degree between users’ expertise and the question topic, and the likelihood of positive response from the invited users. In this paper, we formally formulate the problem and develop a weakly supervised factor graph (WeakFG) model to address the problem. The model explicitly captures expertise matching degree between questions and users. To model the likelihood that an invited user is willing to answer a specific question, we incorporate a set of correlations based on social identity theory into the WeakFG model. We use two different genres of datasets: QA-Expert and Paper-Reviewer, to validate the proposed model. Our experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly outperform (+1.5-10.7% by MAP) the state-of-the-art algorithms for matching users (experts) with community questions. We have also developed an online system to further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method."
10,Translations as Additional Contexts for Sentence Classification,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/550,"In sentence classification tasks, additional contexts, such as the neighboring sentences, may improve the accuracy of the classifier. However, such contexts are domain-dependent and thus cannot be used for another classification task with an inappropriate domain. In contrast, we propose the use of translated sentences as domain-free context that is always available regardless of the domain. We find that naive feature expansion of translations gains only marginal improvements and may decrease the performance of the classifier, due to possible inaccurate translations thus producing noisy sentence vectors. To this end, we present multiple context fixing attachment (MCFA), a series of modules attached to multiple sentence vectors to fix the noise in the vectors using the other sentence vectors as context. We show that our method performs competitively compared to previous models, achieving best classification performance on multiple data sets. We are the first to use translations as domain-free contexts for sentence classification."
11,Empirical Analysis of Foundational Distinctions in Linked Open Data,Main,['Knowledge Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/551,"The Web and its Semantic extension (i.e. Linked Open Data) contain open global-scale knowledge and make it available to potentially intelligent machines that want to benefit from it. Nevertheless, most of Linked Open Data lack ontological distinctions and have sparse axiomatisation. For example, distinctions such as whether an entity is inherently a class or an individual, or whether it is a physical object or not, are hardly expressed in the data, although they have been largely studied and formalised by foundational ontologies (e.g. DOLCE, SUMO). These distinctions belong to common sense too, which is relevant for many artificial intelligence tasks such as natural language understanding, scene recognition, and the like. There is a gap between foundational ontologies, that often formalise or are inspired by pre-existing philosophical theories and are developed with a top-down approach, and Linked Open Data that mostly derive from existing databases or crowd-based effort (e.g. DBpedia, Wikidata). We investigate whether machines can learn foundational distinctions over Linked Open Data entities, and if they match common sense. We want to answer questions such as “does the DBpedia entity for dog refer to a class or to an instance?”. We report on a set of experiments based on machine learning and crowdsourcing that show promising results."
12,"Think Globally, Embed Locally --- Locally Linear Meta-embedding of Words",Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/552,"Distributed word embeddings have shown superior performances in numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performances vary significantly across different tasks, implying that the word embeddings learnt by those methods capture complementary aspects of lexical semantics. Therefore, we believe that it is important to combine the existing word embeddings to produce more accurate and complete meta-embeddings of words. For this purpose, we propose an unsupervised locally linear meta-embedding learning method that takes  pre-trained word embeddings as the input, and produces more accurate meta embeddings. Unlike previously proposed meta-embedding learning methods that learn a global projection over all words in a vocabulary, our proposed method is sensitive to the differences in local neighbourhoods of the individual source word embeddings.  Moreover, we show that vector concatenation, a previously proposed highly competitive baseline approach for integrating word embeddings, can be derived as a special case of the proposed method. Experimental results on semantic similarity, word analogy, relation classification, and short-text classification tasks show that our meta-embeddings to significantly outperform prior methods in several benchmark datasets, establishing a new state of the art for meta-embeddings."
13,An Encoder-Decoder Framework Translating Natural Language to Database Queries,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/553,"Machine translation is going through a radical revolution, driven by the explosive development of deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this paper, we consider a special case in machine translation problems, targeting to convert natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL) for data retrieval over relational database. Although generic CNN and RNN learn the grammar structure of SQL when trained with sufficient samples, the accuracy and training efficiency of the model could be dramatically improved, when the translation model is deeply integrated with the grammar rules of SQL. We present a new encoder-decoder framework, with a suite of new approaches, including new semantic features fed into the encoder, grammar-aware states injected into the memory of decoder, as well as recursive state management for sub-queries. These techniques help the neural network better focus on understanding semantics of operations in natural language and save the efforts on SQL grammar learning. The empirical evaluation on real world database and queries show that our approach outperform state-of-the-art solution by a significant margin."
14,Medical Concept Embedding with Time-Aware Attention,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/554,"Embeddings of medical concepts such as medication, procedure and diagnosis codes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are central to healthcare analytics. Previous work on medical concept embedding takes medical concepts and EMRs as words and documents respectively. Nevertheless, such models miss out the temporal nature of EMR data. On the one hand, two consecutive medical concepts do not indicate they are temporally close, but the correlations between them can be revealed by the time gap. On the other hand, the temporal scopes of medical concepts often vary greatly (e.g., common cold and diabetes). In this paper, we propose to incorporate the temporal information to embed medical codes. Based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model, we employ the attention mechanism to learn a ``soft'' time-aware context window for each medical concept. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets through clustering and nearest neighbour search tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing that it outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines."
15,Point Set Registration for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/555,"Inspired by the observation that word embeddings exhibit isomorphic structure across languages, we propose a novel method to induce a bilingual lexicon from only two sets of word embeddings, which are trained on monolingual source and target data respectively. This is achieved by formulating the task as point set registration which is a more general problem. We show that a transformation from the source to the target embedding space can be learned automatically without any form of cross-lingual supervision. By properly adapting a traditional point set registration model to make it be suitable for processing word embeddings, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on the unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction task. The point set registration problem has been well-studied and can be solved by many elegant models, we thus opened up a new opportunity to capture the universal lexical semantic structure across languages."
16,Co-training Embeddings of Knowledge Graphs and Entity Descriptions for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/556,"Multilingual knowledge graph (KG) embeddings provide latent semantic representations of entities and structured knowledge with cross-lingual inferences, which benefit various knowledge-driven cross-lingual NLP tasks. However, precisely learning such cross-lingual inferences is usually hindered by the low coverage of entity alignment in many KGs. Since many multilingual KGs also provide literal descriptions of entities, in this paper, we introduce an embedding-based approach which leverages a weakly aligned multilingual KG for semi-supervised cross-lingual learning using entity descriptions. Our approach performs co-training of two embedding models, i.e. a multilingual KG embedding model and a multilingual literal description embedding model. The models are trained on a large Wikipedia-based trilingual dataset where most entity alignment is unknown to training. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed approach on the entity alignment task improves at each iteration of co-training, and eventually reaches a stage at which it significantly surpasses previous approaches. We also show that our approach has promising abilities for zero-shot entity alignment, and cross-lingual KG completion."
17,TreeNet: Learning Sentence Representations with Unconstrained Tree Structure,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/557,"Recursive neural network (RvNN) has been proved to be an effective and promising tool to learn sentence representations by explicitly exploiting the sentence structure. However, most existing work can only exploit simple tree structure, e.g., binary trees, or ignore the order of nodes, which yields suboptimal performance. In this paper, we proposed a novel neural network, namely TreeNet, to capture sentences structurally over the raw unconstrained constituency trees, where the number of child nodes can be arbitrary. In TreeNet, each node is learning from its left sibling and right child in a bottom-up left-to-right order, thus enabling the net to learn over any tree. Furthermore, multiple soft gates and a memory cell are employed in implementing the TreeNet to determine to what extent it should learn, remember and output, which proves to be a simple and efficient mechanism for semantic synthesis. Moreover, TreeNet significantly suppresses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with fewer parameters. It improves the classification accuracy by 2%-5% with 42% of the best CNN’s parameters or 94% of standard LSTM’s. Extensive experiments demonstrate TreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all four typical text classification tasks."
18,Adversarial Active  Learning for Sequences Labeling and Generation,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/558,"We introduce an active learning framework for general sequence learning tasks including sequence labeling and generation. Most existing active learning algorithms mainly rely on an uncertainty measure derived from the probabilistic classifier for query sample selection. However, such approaches suffer from two shortcomings in the context of sequence learning including 1) cold start problem and 2) label sampling dilemma. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a deep-learning-based active learning framework to directly identify query samples from the perspective of adversarial learning.  Our approach intends to offer labeling  priorities for sequences whose information content are least covered by existing labeled data. We verify our sequence-based active learning approach  on two tasks including sequence labeling and sequence generation."
19,Submodularity-Inspired Data Selection for Goal-Oriented Chatbot Training Based on Sentence Embeddings ,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/559,"Spoken language understanding (SLU) systems, such as goal-oriented chatbots or personal assistants, rely on an initial natural language understanding (NLU) module to determine the intent and to extract the relevant information from the user queries they take as input. SLU systems usually help users to solve problems in relatively narrow domains and require a large amount of in-domain training data. This leads to significant data availability issues that inhibit the development of successful systems. To alleviate this problem, we propose a technique of data selection in the low-data regime that enables us to train with fewer labeled sentences, thus smaller labelling costs. We propose a submodularity-inspired data ranking function, the ratio-penalty marginal gain, for selecting data points to label based only on the information extracted from the textual embedding space. We show that the distances in the embedding space are a viable source of information that can be used for data selection. Our method outperforms two known active learning techniques and enables  cost-efficient training of the NLU unit. Moreover, our proposed selection technique does not need the model to be retrained in between the selection steps, making it time efficient as well."
20,Domain Adaptation via Tree Kernel Based Maximum Mean Discrepancy for User Consumption Intention Identification,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/560,"Identifying user consumption intention from social media is of great interests to downstream applications. Since such task is domain-dependent, deep neural networks have been applied to learn transferable features for adapting models from a source domain to a target domain. A basic idea to solve this problem is reducing the distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain such that the transfer error can be bounded. However, the feature transferability drops dramatically in higher layers of deep neural networks with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, previous work has to use a few target domain annotated data to train domain-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework for consumption intention identification, to reduce the data bias and enhance the transferability in domain-specific layers. In our framework, the representation of the domain-specific layer is mapped to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. By using an optimal tree kernel method for measuring the mean embedding matching, the domain discrepancy can be effectively reduced. The framework can learn transferable features in a completely unsupervised manner with statistical guarantees. Experimental results on five different domain datasets show that our approach dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and it is general enough to be applied to more scenarios. The source code and datasets can be found at http://ir.hit.edu.cn/$\scriptsize{\sim}$xding/index\_english.htm."
21,Attention-Fused Deep Matching Network for Natural Language Inference,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/561,"Natural language inference aims to predict whether a premise sentence can infer another hypothesis sentence. Recent progress on this task only relies on a shallow interaction between sentence pairs, which is insufficient for modeling complex relations. In this paper, we present an attention-fused deep matching network (AF-DMN) for natural language inference. Unlike existing models, AF-DMN takes two sentences as input and iteratively learns the attention-aware representations for each side by multi-level interactions. Moreover, we add a self-attention mechanism to fully exploit local context information within each sentence. Experiment results show that AF-DMN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms strong baselines on Stanford natural language inference (SNLI), multi-genre natural language inference (MultiNLI), and Quora duplicate questions datasets."
22,A Deep Modular RNN Approach for Ethos Mining,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/562,"Automatically recognising and extracting the reasoning expressed in natural language text is extremely demanding and only very recently has there been significant headway. While such argument mining focuses on logos (the content of what is said) evidence has demonstrated that using ethos (the character of the speaker) can sometimes be an even more powerful tool of influence. We study the UK parliamentary debates which furnish a rich source of ethos with linguistic material signalling the ethotic relationships between politicians. We then develop a novel deep modular recurrent neural network, DMRNN, approach and employ proven methods from argument mining and sentiment analysis to create an ethos mining pipeline. Annotation of ethotic statements is reliable and its extraction is robust (macro-F1 = 0.83), while annotation of polarity is perfect and its extraction is solid (macro-F1 = 0.84). By exploring correspondences between ethos in political discourse and major events in the political landscape through ethos analytics, we uncover tantalising evidence that identifying expressions of positive and negative ethotic sentiment is a powerful instrument for understanding the dynamics of governments."
23,A Question Type Driven Framework to Diversify Visual Question Generation,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/563,"Visual question generation aims at asking questions about an image automatically. Existing research works on this topic usually generate a single question for each given image without considering the issue of diversity. In this paper, we propose a question type driven framework to produce multiple questions for a given image with different focuses. In our framework, each question is constructed following the guidance of a sampled question type in a sequence-to-sequence fashion. To diversify the generated questions, a novel conditional variational auto-encoder is introduced to generate multiple questions with a specific question type. Moreover, we design a strategy to conduct the question type distribution learning for each image to select the final questions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both relevance and diversity."
24,Efficient Pruning of Large  Knowledge Graphs,Main,['Knowledge Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/564,"In this paper we present an efficient and highly accurate algorithm to prune noisy or over-ambiguous knowledge graphs given as input an extensional definition of a domain of interest, namely as a set of instances or concepts. Our method climbs the graph in a bottom-up fashion, iteratively layering the graph and pruning nodes and edges in each layer while not compromising the connectivity of the set of input nodes. Iterative layering and protection of pre-defined nodes allow to extract semantically coherent DAG structures from noisy or over-ambiguous cyclic graphs, without loss of information and without incurring in computational bottlenecks, which are the main problem of state-of-the-art methods for cleaning large, i.e., Web-scale, knowledge graphs. We apply our algorithm to the tasks of pruning automatically acquired taxonomies using benchmarking data from a SemEval evaluation exercise, as well as the extraction of a domain-adapted taxonomy from the Wikipedia category hierarchy. The results show the superiority of our approach over state-of-art algorithms in terms of both output quality and computational efficiency."
25,Extracting Action Sequences from Texts Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/565,"Extracting action sequences from texts is challenging, as it  requires commonsense inferences based on world knowledge. Although there has been work on extracting action scripts, instructions, navigation actions, etc., they require either the set of candidate actions be provided in advance, or action descriptions are restricted to a specific form, e.g., description templates. In this paper we aim to extract action sequences from texts in \emph{free} natural language, i.e., without any restricted templates, provided the set of actions is unknown. We propose to extract action sequences from texts based on the deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we view ``selecting'' or ``eliminating'' words from texts as ``actions'', and texts associated with actions as ``states''. We build Q-networks to learn policies of extracting actions and extract plans from the labeled texts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several datasets with comparison to state-of-the-art approaches."
26,Improving Low Resource Named Entity Recognition using Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/566,"Neural networks have been widely used for high resource language (e.g. English) named entity recognition (NER) and have shown state-of-the-art results.However, for low resource languages, such as Dutch, Spanish, due to the limitation of resources and lack of annotated data, taggers tend to have lower performances.To narrow this gap, we propose three novel strategies to enrich the semantic representations of low resource languages: we first develop neural networks to improve low resource word representations by knowledge transfer from high resource language using bilingual lexicons. Further, a lexicon extension strategy is designed to address out-of lexicon problem by automatically learning semantic projections.Thirdly, we regard word-level entity type distribution features as an external language-independent knowledge and incorporate them into our neural architecture. Experiments on two low resource languages (including Dutch and Spanish) demonstrate the effectiveness of these additional semantic representations (average 4.8\% improvement). Moreover, on Chinese OntoNotes 4.0 dataset, our approach achieved an F-score of 83.07\% with 2.91\% absolute gain compared to the state-of-the-art results."
27,Topic-to-Essay Generation with Neural Networks,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/567,"We focus on essay generation, which is a challenging task that generates a paragraph-level text with multiple topics.Progress towards understanding different topics and expressing diversity in this task requires more powerful generators and richer training and evaluation resources. To address this,  we develop a multi-topic aware long short-term memory (MTA-LSTM) network.In this model, we maintain a novel multi-topic coverage vector, which learns the weight of each topic and is sequentially updated during the decoding process.Afterwards this vector is fed to an attention model to guide the generator.Moreover, we automatically construct two paragraph-level Chinese essay corpora, 305,000 essay paragraphs and 55,000 question-and-answer pairs.Empirical results show that our approach obtains much better BLEU score compared to various baselines.Furthermore, human judgment shows that MTA-LSTM has the ability to generate essays that are not only coherent but also closely related to the input topics."
28,EZLearn: Exploiting Organic Supervision in Automated Data Annotation,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/568,"Many real-world applications require automated data annotation, such as identifying tissue origins based on gene expressions and classifying images into semantic categories. Annotation classes are often numerous and subject to changes over time, and annotating examples has become the major bottleneck for supervised learning methods. In science and other high-value domains, large repositories of data samples are often available, together with two sources of organic supervision: a lexicon for the annotation classes, and text descriptions that accompany some data samples. Distant supervision has emerged as a promising paradigm for exploiting such indirect supervision by automatically annotating examples where the text description contains a class mention in the lexicon. However, due to linguistic variations and ambiguities, such training data is inherently noisy, which limits the accuracy in this approach. In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary natural language processing system for the text modality, and incorporate co-training to reduce noise and augment signal in distant supervision. Without using any manually labeled data, our EZLearn system learned to accurately annotate data samples in functional genomics and scientific figure comprehension, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on tens of thousands of annotated examples."
29,Approximating Word Ranking and Negative Sampling for Word Embedding,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/569,"CBOW (Continuous Bag-Of-Words) is  one of the most commonly used techniques to generate word embeddings in various NLP tasks. However, it fails to reach the optimal performance due to uniform involvements of positive words and a simple sampling distribution of negative words. To resolve these issues, we propose OptRank to optimize word ranking and approximate negative sampling for bettering word embedding. Specifically, we first formalize word embedding as a ranking problem. Then, we weigh the positive words by their ranks such that highly ranked words have more importance, and adopt a dynamic sampling strategy to select informative negative words. In addition, an approximation method is designed to efficiently compute word ranks. Empirical experiments show that OptRank consistently outperforms its counterparts on a benchmark dataset with different sampling scales, especially when the sampled subset is small. The code and datasets can be obtained from https://github.com/ouououououou/OptRank."
30,Reinforced Mnemonic Reader for Machine Reading Comprehension,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/570,"In this paper, we introduce the Reinforced Mnemonic Reader for machine reading comprehension tasks, which enhances previous attentive readers in two aspects. First, a reattention mechanism is proposed to refine current attentions by directly accessing to past attentions that are temporally memorized in a multi-round alignment architecture, so as to avoid the problems of attention redundancy and attention deficiency. Second, a new optimization approach, called dynamic-critical reinforcement learning, is introduced to extend the standard supervised method. It always encourages to predict a more acceptable answer so as to address the convergence suppression problem occurred in traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results. Meanwhile, our model outperforms previous systems by over 6% in terms of both Exact Match and F1 metrics on two adversarial SQuAD datasets."
31,Improving Entity Recommendation with Search Log and Multi-Task Learning,Main,"['Information Retrieval', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/571,"Entity recommendation, providing search users with an improved experience by assisting them in finding related entities for a given query, has become an indispensable feature of today's Web search engine. Existing studies typically only consider the query issued at the current time step while ignoring the in-session preceding queries. Thus, they typically fail to handle the ambiguous queries such as ""apple"" because the model could not understand which apple (company or fruit) is talked about. In this work, we believe that the in-session contexts convey valuable evidences that could facilitate the semantic modeling of queries, and take that into consideration for entity recommendation. Furthermore, in order to better model the semantics of queries, we learn the model in a multi-task learning setting where the query representation is shared across entity recommendation and context-aware ranking.  We evaluate our approach using large-scale, real-world search logs of a widely used commercial Web search engine. The experimental results show that incorporating context information significantly improves entity recommendation, and learning the model in a multi-task learning setting could bring further improvements."
32,Goal-Oriented Chatbot Dialog Management Bootstrapping with Transfer Learning,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/572,"Goal-Oriented (GO) Dialogue Systems, colloquially known as goal oriented chatbots, help users achieve a predefined goal (e.g. book a movie ticket) within a closed domain. A first step is to understand the user's goal by using natural language understanding techniques. Once the goal is known, the bot must manage a dialogue to achieve that goal, which is conducted with respect to a learnt policy. The success of the dialogue system depends on the quality of the policy, which is in turn reliant on the availability of high-quality training data for the policy learning method, for instance Deep Reinforcement Learning. Due to the domain specificity, the amount of available data is typically too low to allow the training of good dialogue policies. In this paper we introduce a transfer learning method to mitigate the effects of the low in-domain data availability. Our transfer learning based approach improves the bot's success rate by 20% in relative terms for distant domains and we more than double it for close domains, compared to the model without transfer learning. Moreover, the transfer learning chatbots learn the policy up to 5 to 10 times faster. Finally, as the transfer learning approach is complementary to additional processing such as warm-starting, we show that their joint application gives the best outcomes."
33,Mitigating the Effect of Out-of-Vocabulary Entity Pairs in Matrix Factorization for KB Inference,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/573,"This paper analyzes the varied performance of Matrix Factorization (MF) on the related tasks of relation extraction and knowledge-base completion, which have been unified recently into a single framework of knowledge-base inference (KBI) [Toutanova et al., 2015]. We first propose a new evaluation protocol that makes comparisons between MF and Tensor Factorization (TF) models fair. We find that this results in a steep drop in MF performance. Our analysis attributes this to the high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of entity pairs in test folds of commonly-used datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose three extensions to MF. Our best model is a TF-augmented MF model. This hybrid model is robust and obtains strong results across various KBI datasets."
34,Learning to Give Feedback: Modeling Attributes Affecting Argument Persuasiveness in Student Essays,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/574,"Argument persuasiveness is one of the most important dimensions of argumentative essay quality, yet it is little studied in automated essay scoring research. Using a recently released corpus of essays that are simultaneously annotated with argument components, argument persuasiveness scores, and attributes of argument components that impact an argument’s persuasiveness, we design and train the first set of neural models that predict the persuasiveness of an argument and its attributes in a student essay, enabling useful feedback to be provided to students on why their arguments are (un)persuasive in addition to how persuasive they are."
35,ACV-tree: A New  Method for  Sentence Similarity Modeling,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/575,"Sentence similarity modeling lies at the core of many natural language processing applications, and thus has received much attention. Owing to the success of word embeddings, recently, popular neural network methods have achieved sentence embedding, obtaining attractive performance. Nevertheless, most of them focused on learning semantic information and modeling it as a continuous vector, while the syntactic information of sentences has not been fully exploited. On the other hand, prior works have shown the benefits of structured trees that include syntactic information, while few methods in this branch utilized the advantages of word embeddings and another powerful technique ? attention weight mechanism. This paper makes the first attempt to absorb their advantages by merging these techniques in a unified structure, dubbed as ACV-tree. Meanwhile, this paper develops a new tree kernel, known as ACVT kernel, that is tailored for sentence similarity measure based on the proposed structure. The experimental results, based on 19 widely-used datasets, demonstrate that our model is effective and competitive, compared against state-of-the-art models."
36,An Adaptive Hierarchical Compositional Model for Phrase Embedding,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/576,"Phrase embedding aims at representing phrases in a vector space and it is important for the performance of many NLP tasks. Existing models only regard a phrase as either full-compositional or non-compositional, while ignoring the hybrid-compositionality that widely exists, especially in long phrases. This drawback prevents them from having a deeper insight into the semantic structure for long phrases and as a consequence, weakens the accuracy of the embeddings. In this paper, we present a novel method for jointly learning compositionality and phrase embedding by adaptively weighting different compositions using an implicit hierarchical structure. Our model has the ability of adaptively adjusting among different compositions without entailing too much model complexity and time cost. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first effort that considers hybrid-compositionality in phrase embedding. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both similarity tasks and analogy tasks."
37,Multi-modal Sentence Summarization with Modality Attention and Image Filtering,Main,"['Natural Language Summarization', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/577,"In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal sentence summarization task that produces a short summary from a pair of sentence and image. This task is more challenging than sentence summarization. It not only needs to effectively incorporate visual features into standard text summarization framework, but also requires to avoid noise of image. To this end, we propose a modality-based attention mechanism to pay different attention to image patches and text units, and we design image filters to selectively use visual information to enhance the semantics of the input sentence. We construct a multimodal sentence summarization dataset and extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our models significantly outperform conventional models which only employ text as input. Further analyses suggest that sentence summarization task can benefit from visually grounded representations from a variety of aspects."
38,Code Completion with Neural Attention and Pointer Networks,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/578,"Intelligent code completion has become an essential research task to accelerate modern software development. To facilitate effective code completion for dynamically-typed programming languages, we apply neural language models by learning from large codebases, and develop a tailored attention mechanism for code completion. However, standard neural language models even with attention mechanism cannot correctly predict the out-of-vocabulary (OoV) words that restrict the code completion performance. In this paper, inspired by the prevalence of locally repeated terms in program source code, and the recently proposed pointer copy mechanism, we propose a pointer mixture network for better predicting OoV words in code completion. Based on the context, the pointer mixture network learns to either generate a within-vocabulary word through an RNN component, or regenerate an OoV word from local context through a pointer component. Experiments on two benchmarked datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attention mechanism and pointer mixture network on the code completion task."
39,SegBot: A Generic Neural Text Segmentation Model with Pointer Network,Main,"['Discourse', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/579,"Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing that comes in two levels of granularity: (i) segmenting a document into a sequence of topical segments (topic segmentation), and (ii) segmenting a sentence into a sequence of elementary discourse units (EDU segmentation). Traditional solutions to the two tasks heavily rely on carefully designed features. The recently proposed neural models do not need manual feature engineering, but they either suffer from sparse boundary tags or they cannot well handle  the issue of variable size output vocabulary.  We propose a generic end-to-end segmentation model called SegBot. SegBot uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network to encode input text sequence. The model then uses another recurrent neural network together with a pointer network to select text boundaries in the input sequence. In this way, SegBot does not require hand-crafted features. More importantly, our model inherently handles the issue of variable size output vocabulary and the issue of sparse boundary tags. In our experiments, SegBot outperforms  state-of-the-art models on both topic and EDU segmentation tasks."
40,Adaboost with Auto-Evaluation for Conversational Models,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/580,"We propose a boosting method for conversational models to encourage them to generate more human-like dialogs. In our method, we consider existing conversational models as weak generators and apply Adaboost to update those models. However, conventional Adaboost cannot be directly applied on conversational models. Because for conversational models, conventional Adaboost cannot adaptively adjust the weight on the instance for subsequent learning, result from the simple comparison between the true output y (to an input x) and its corresponding predicted output y' cannot directly evaluate the learning performance on x. To address this issue, we develop the Adaboost with Auto-Evaluation (called AwE). In AwE, an auto-evaluator is proposed to evaluate the predicted results, which makes it applicable to conversational models. Furthermore, we present the theoretical analysis that the training error drops exponentially fast only if certain assumption over the proposed auto-evaluator holds. Finally, we empirically show that AwE visibly boosts the performance of existing single conversational models and also outperforms the other ensemble methods for conversational models."
41,Non-translational Alignment for Multi-relational Networks,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/581,"Most existing solutions for the alignment of multi-relational networks, such as multi-lingual knowledge bases, are ``translation''-based which facilitate the network embedding via the trans-family, such as TransE. However, they cannot address triangular or other structural properties effectively. Thus, we propose a non-translational approach, which aims to utilize a probabilistic model to offer more robust solutions to the alignment task, by exploring the structural properties as well as leveraging on anchors to project each network onto the same vector space during the process of learning the representation of individual networks. The extensive experiments on four multi-lingual knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method over a set of state-of-the-art alignment methods."
42,Learning Word Vectors with Linear Constraints: A Matrix Factorization Approach,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/582,"Learning vector space representation of words, or word embedding, has attracted much recent research attention. With the objective of better capturing the semantic and syntactic information inherent in words, we propose two new embedding models based on the singular value decomposition of lexical co-occurrences of words. Different from previous work, our proposed models allow for injecting linear constraints when performing the decomposition, with which the desired semantic and syntactic information will be maintained in word vectors. Conceptually the models are flexible and convenient to encode prior knowledge about words. Computationally they can be easily solved by direct matrix factorization. Surprisingly simple yet effective, the proposed models have reported significantly improved performance in empirical word analogy and sentence classification evaluations, and demonstrated high potentials in practical applications."
43,Aspect Term Extraction with History Attention and Selective Transformation,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/583,"Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), a key sub-task in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, aims to extract explicit aspect expressions from online user reviews. We present a new framework for tackling ATE. It can exploit two useful clues, namely opinion summary and aspect detection history. Opinion summary is distilled from the whole input sentence, conditioned on each current token for aspect prediction, and thus the tailor-made summary can help aspect prediction on this token. On the other hand, the aspect detection history information is distilled from the previous aspect predictions, and it can leverage the coordinate structure and tagging schema constraints to upgrade the aspect prediction. Experimental results over four benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that our framework can outperform all state-of-the-art methods."
44,Constructing Narrative Event Evolutionary Graph for Script Event Prediction,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/584,"Script event prediction requires a model to predict the subsequent event given an existing event context. Previous models based on event pairs or event chains cannot make full use of dense event connections, which may limit their capability of event prediction. To remedy this, we propose constructing an event graph to better utilize the event network information for script event prediction. In particular, we first extract narrative event chains from large quantities of news corpus, and then construct a narrative event evolutionary graph (NEEG) based on the extracted chains. NEEG can be seen as a knowledge base that describes event evolutionary principles and patterns. To solve the inference problem on NEEG, we present a scaled graph neural network (SGNN) to model event interactions and learn better event representations. Instead of computing the representations on the whole graph, SGNN processes only the concerned nodes each time, which makes our model feasible to large-scale graphs. By comparing the similarity between input context event representations and candidate event representations, we can choose the most reasonable subsequent event. Experimental results on widely used New York Times corpus demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, by using standard multiple choice narrative cloze evaluation."
45,Deep Text Classification Can be Fooled,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/585,"In this paper, we present an effective method to craft text adversarial samples, revealing one important yet underestimated fact that DNN-based text classifiers are also prone to adversarial sample attack. Specifically, confronted with different adversarial scenarios, the text items that are important for classification are identified by computing the cost gradients of the input (white-box attack) or generating a series of occluded test samples (black-box attack). Based on these items, we design three perturbation strategies, namely insertion, modification, and removal, to generate adversarial samples. The experiment results show that the adversarial samples generated by our method can successfully fool both state-of-the-art character-level and word-level DNN-based text classifiers. The adversarial samples can be perturbed to any desirable classes without compromising their utilities. At the same time, the introduced perturbation is difficult to be perceived."
46,Feature Enhancement in Attention for Visual Question Answering,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/586,"Attention mechanism has been an indispensable part of Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, due to the importance of its selective ability on image regions and/or question words. However, attention mechanism in almost all the VQA models takes as input the image visual and question textual features, which stem from different sources and between which there exists essential semantic gap. In order to further improve the accuracy of correlation between region and question in attention, we focus on region representation and propose the idea of feature enhancement, which includes three aspects. (1) We propose to leverage region semantic representation which is more consistent with the question representation. (2) We enrich the region representation using features from multiple hierarchies and (3) we refine the semantic representation for richer information. With these three incremental feature enhancement mechanisms, we improve the region representation and achieve better attentive effect and VQA performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the largest VQA v2.0 benchmark dataset and achieve competitive results without additional training data, and prove the effectiveness of our proposed feature-enhanced attention by visual demonstrations."
47,Curriculum Learning for Natural Answer Generation,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/587,"By reason of being able to obtain natural language responses, natural answers are more favored in real-world Question Answering (QA) systems. Generative models learn to automatically generate natural answers from large-scale question answer pairs (QA-pairs). However, they are suffering from the uncontrollable and uneven quality of QA-pairs crawled from the Internet. To address this problem, we propose a curriculum learning based framework for natural answer generation (CL-NAG), which is able to take full advantage of the valuable learning data from a noisy and uneven-quality corpus. Specifically, we employ two practical measures to automatically measure the quality (complexity) of QA-pairs. Based on the measurements, CL-NAG firstly utilizes simple and low-quality QA-pairs to learn a basic model, and then gradually learns to produce better answers with richer contents and more complete syntaxes based on more complex and higher-quality QA-pairs. In this way, all valuable information in the noisy and uneven-quality corpus could be fully exploited. Experiments demonstrate that CL-NAG outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which increases 6.8% and 8.7% in the accuracy for simple and complex questions, respectively."
48,Learning to Explain Ambiguous Headlines of Online News,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/588,"With the purpose of attracting clicks, online news publishers and editors use diverse strategies to make their headlines catchy, with a sacrifice of accuracy. Specifically, a considerable portion of news headlines is ambiguous. Such headlines are unclear relative to the content of the story, and largely degrade the reading experience of the audience. In this paper, we focus on dealing with the information gap caused by the ambiguous news headlines. We define a new task of explaining ambiguous headlines with short informative texts, and build a benchmark dataset for evaluation. We address the task by selecting a proper sentence from the news body to resolve the ambiguity in an ambiguous headline. Both feature engineering methods and neural network methods are explored. For feature engineering, we improve a standard SVM classifier with elaborately designed features. For neural networks, we propose an ambiguity-aware neural matching model based on a previous model. Utilizing automatic and manual evaluation metrics,  we demonstrate the efficacy and the complementarity of the two methods, and the ambiguity-aware neural matching model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on this challenging task."
49,Jumper: Learning When to Make Classification Decision in Reading,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/589,"In early years, text classification is typically accomplished by feature-based classifiers; recently, neural networks, as powerful classifiers, make it possible to work with raw input as the text stands. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Jumper, inspired by the cognitive process of text reading, that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Basically, Jumper is a neural system that can scan a piece of text sequentially and make classification decision at the time it chooses. Both the classification and when to make the classification are part of the decision process which are controlled by the policy net and trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the overall classification accuracy. Experimental results show that a properly trained Jumper has the following properties: (1) It can make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing the total text reading by 30~40% and often finding the key rationale of prediction. (2) It can achieve classification accuracy better or comparable to state-of-the-art model in several benchmark and industrial datasets."
50,Beyond Polarity: Interpretable Financial Sentiment Analysis with Hierarchical Query-driven Attention,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/590,"Sentiment analysis has played a significant role in financial applications in recent years. The informational and emotive aspects of news texts may affect the prices, volatilities, volume of trades, and even potential risks of financial subjects. Previous studies in this field mainly focused on identifying polarity~(e.g. positive or negative). However, as financial decisions broadly require justifications, only plausible polarity cannot provide enough evidence during the decision making processes of humanity. Hence an explainable solution is in urgent demand. In this paper, we present an interpretable neural net framework for financial sentiment analysis. First, we design a hierarchical model to learn the representation of a document from multiple granularities. In addition, we propose a query-driven attention mechanism to satisfy the unique characteristics of financial documents. With the domain specified questions provided by the financial analysts, we can discover different spotlights for queries from different aspects. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that our framework can learn better representation of the document and unearth meaningful clues on replying different users? preferences. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on sentiment prediction of financial documents."
51,A Hierarchical End-to-End Model for Jointly Improving Text Summarization and Sentiment Classification,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/591,"Text summarization and sentiment classification both aim to capture the main ideas of the text but at different levels. Text summarization is to describe the text within a few sentences, while sentiment classification can be regarded as a special type of summarization which ``summarizes'' the text into a even more abstract fashion, i.e., a sentiment class. Based on this idea, we propose a hierarchical end-to-end model for joint learning of text summarization and sentiment classification, where the sentiment classification label is treated as the further ``summarization'' of the text summarization output. Hence, the sentiment classification layer is put upon the text summarization layer, and a hierarchical structure is derived. Experimental results on Amazon online reviews datasets show that our model achieves better performance than the strong baseline systems on both abstractive summarization and sentiment classification."
52,Show and Tell More: Topic-Oriented Multi-Sentence Image Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/592,"Image captioning aims to generate textual descriptions for images. Most previous work generates a single-sentence description for each image. However, a picture is worth a thousand words. Single-sentence can hardly give a complete view of an image even by humans. In this paper, we propose a novel Topic-Oriented Multi-Sentence (\emph{TOMS}) captioning model, which can generate multiple topic-oriented sentences to describe an image. Different from object instances or attributes, topics mined by the latent Dirichlet allocation reflect hidden thematic structures in reference sentences of an image. In our model, each topic is integrated to a caption generator with a Fusion Gate Unit (FGU) to guide the generation of a sentence towards a certain topic perspective. With multiple sentences from different topics, our \emph{TOMS} provides a complete description of an image. Experimental results on both sentence and paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our \emph{TOMS} in terms of topical consistency and descriptive completeness."
53,Answering Mixed Type Questions about Daily Living Episodes,Main,"['Question Answering', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/593,"We propose a physical-world question-answering (QA) method, where the system answers a text question about the physical world by searching a given sequence of sentences about daily-life episodes. To address various information needs in a physical world situation, the physical-world QA methods have to generate mixed-type responses (e.g. word sequence, word set, number, and time as well as a single word) according to the content of questions, after reading physical-world event stories. Most existing methods only provide words or choose answers from multiple candidates. In this paper, we use multiple decoders to generate a mixed-type answer encoding daily episodes with a memory architecture that can capture short- and long-term event dependencies. Results using house-activity stories show that the use of multiple decoders with memory components is effective for answering various physical-world QA questions."
54,ElimiNet: A Model for Eliminating Options for Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/594,"The task of Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions, requires a human (or machine) to read a given {passage, question} pair and select one of the n given options. The current state of the art model for this task first computes a question-aware representation for the passage and then selects the option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of elimination and selection. Specifically, a human would first try to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the passage again in the light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose ElimiNet, a neural network-based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the {passage, question} pair and if so it tries to make the passage representation orthogonal to this eliminated option (akin to ignoring portions of the passage corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the passage representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently released large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current state of the art model on 7 out of the 13 question types in this dataset. Further, we show that taking an ensemble of our elimination-selection based method with a selection based method gives us an improvement of 3.1% over the best-reported performance on this dataset."
55,Assigning Personality/Profile to a Chatting Machine for Coherent Conversation Generation,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/595,"Endowing a chatbot with personality is challenging but significant to deliver more realistic and natural conversations. In this paper, we address the issue of generating responses that are coherent to a pre-specified personality or profile. We present a method that uses generic conversation data from social media (without speaker identities) to generate profile-coherent responses. The central idea is to detect whether a profile should be used when responding to a user post (by a profile detector), and if necessary, select a key-value pair from the profile to generate a response forward and backward (by a bidirectional decoder) so that a personality-coherent response can be generated. Furthermore, in order to train the bidirectional decoder with generic dialogue data, a position detector is designed to predict a word position from which decoding should start given a profile value. Manual and automatic evaluation shows that our model can deliver more coherent, natural, and diversified responses."
56,Translating Embeddings for Knowledge Graph Completion with Relation Attention Mechanism,Main,"['Knowledge Extraction', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/596,"Knowledge graph embedding is an essential problem in knowledge extraction. Recently, translation based embedding models (e.g., TransE) have received increasingly attentions. These methods try to interpret the relations among entities as translations from head entity to tail entity and achieve promising performance on knowledge graph completion. Previous researchers attempt to transform the entity embedding concerning the given relation for distinguishability. Also, they naturally think the relation-related transforming should reflect attention mechanism, which means it should focus on only a part of the attributes. However, we found previous methods are failed with creating attention mechanism, and the reason is that they ignore the hierarchical routine of human cognition. When predicting whether a relation holds between two entities, people first check the category of entities, then they focus on fined-grained relation-related attributes to make the decision. In other words, the attention should take effect on entities filtered by the right category. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding method named TransAt to learn the translation based embedding, relation-related categories of entities and relation-related attention simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly on public datasets, and our method can learn the true attention varying among relations."

Traditional research heavily relies on annotated texts. This paper proposes a two-step framework, first extracting essential factors related with event factuality from raw texts as the input, and then identifying the factuality of events via a Generative Adversarial Network with Auxiliary Classification (AC-GAN). The use of AC-GAN allows the model to learn more syntactic information and address the imbalance among factuality values. Experimental results on FactBank show that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, particularly on events with embedded sources, speculative and negative factuality values."
58,Inferring Temporal Knowledge for Near-Periodic Recurrent Events,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/598,"We define the novel problem of extracting and predicting occurrence dates for a class of recurrent events -- events that are held periodically as per a near-regular schedule (e.g., conferences, film festivals, sport championships). Knowledge-bases such as Freebase contain a large number of such recurring events, but they also miss substantial information regarding specific event instances and their occurrence dates. We develop a temporal extraction and inference engine to fill in the missing dates as well as to predict their future occurrences. Our engine performs joint inference over several knowledge sources -- (1) information about an event instance and its date extracted from text by our temporal extractor, (2) information about the typical schedule (e.g., ``every second week of June"") for a recurrent event extracted by our schedule extractor, and (3) known dates for other instances of the same event. The output of our system is a representation for the event schedule and an occurrence date for each event instance. We find that our system beats humans in predicting future occurrences of recurrent events by significant margins. We release our code and system output for further research."

However, after deployment, these parsers suffer from poor accuracy on encountering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, or significant accuracy drop on previously supported instructions after retraining. Achieving both goals simultaneously is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose novel neural networks based parsers to learn OOV words; one incorporating a new hybrid paraphrase generation model, and an enhanced sequence-to-sequence model. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and custom datasets show our new parsers achieve significant accuracy gain on OOV words and phrases, and in the meanwhile learn OOV words while maintaining accuracy on previously supported instructions."
60,Joint Posterior Revision of NLP Annotations via Ontological Knowledge,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/600,"Different well-established NLP tasks contribute to elicit the semantics of entities mentioned in natural language text, such as Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) and Entity Linking (EL). However, combining the outcomes of these tasks may result in NLP annotations --- such as a NERC organization linked by EL to a person --- that are unlikely or contradictory when interpreted in the light of common world knowledge about the entities these annotations refer to. We thus propose a general probabilistic model that explicitly captures the relations between multiple NLP annotations for an entity mention, the ontological entity classes implied by those annotations, and the background ontological knowledge those classes may be consistent with. We use the model to estimate the posterior probability of NLP annotations given their confidences (prior probabilities) and the ontological knowledge, and consequently revise the best annotation choice performed by the NLP tools. In a concrete scenario with two state-of-the-art tools for NERC and EL, we experimentally show on three reference datasets that for these tasks, the joint annotation revision performed by the model consistently improves on the original results of the tools."
61,Interpretable Adversarial Perturbation in Input Embedding Space for Text,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/601,"Following great success in the image processing field, the idea of adversarial training has been applied to tasks in the natural language processing (NLP) field. One promising approach directly applies adversarial training developed in the image processing field to the input word embedding space instead of the discrete input space of texts. However, this approach abandons such interpretability as generating adversarial texts to significantly improve the performance of NLP tasks. This paper restores interpretability to such methods by restricting the directions of perturbations toward the existing words in the input embedding space. As a result, we can straightforwardly reconstruct each input with perturbations to an actual text by considering the perturbations to be the replacement of words in the sentence while maintaining or even improving the task performance."

However, Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) systems that focus on syntactically correct and semantically complete queries to obtain high precision answers require a fundamentally different approach to the query completion problem as opposed to IR systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to focus on the problem of query completion for NLIDB systems. In particular, we introduce a novel concept of functional partitioning of an ontology and then design algorithms to intelligently use the components obtained from functional partitioning to extend a state-of-the-art NLIDB system to produce accurate and semantically meaningful query completions in the absence of query logs. We test the proposed query completion framework on multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of our technique empirically."

In the training of the generation models, existing methods generally treat all the training data equivalently. However, the data crawled from the websites may contain many noises. Blindly training with the noisy data could harm the performance of the final generation model. In this paper, we propose a generation with calibration framework, that allows high- quality data to have more influences on the generation model and reduces the effect of noisy data. Specifically, for each instance in training set, we employ a calibration network to produce a quality score for it, then the score is used for the weighted update of the generation model parameters. Experiments show that the calibrated model outperforms baseline methods on both automatic evaluation metrics and human annotations."
64,Reinforced Self-Attention Network: a Hybrid of Hard and Soft Attention for Sequence Modeling,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/604,"Many natural language processing tasks solely rely on sparse dependencies between a few tokens in a sentence. Soft attention mechanisms show promising performance in modeling local/global dependencies by soft probabilities between every two tokens, but they are not effective and efficient when applied to long sentences. By contrast, hard attention mechanisms directly select a subset of tokens but are difficult and inefficient to train due to their combinatorial nature. In this paper, we integrate both soft and hard attention into one context fusion model, ""reinforced self-attention (ReSA)"", for the mutual benefit of each other. In ReSA, a hard attention trims a sequence for a soft self-attention to process, while the soft attention feeds reward signals back to facilitate the training of the hard one. For this purpose, we develop a novel hard attention called ""reinforced sequence sampling (RSS)"", selecting tokens in parallel and trained via policy gradient. Using two RSS modules, ReSA efficiently extracts the sparse dependencies between each pair of selected tokens. We finally propose an RNN/CNN-free sentence-encoding model, ""reinforced self-attention network (ReSAN)"", solely based on ReSA.  It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) datasets."
65,"Listen, Think and Listen Again: Capturing Top-down Auditory Attention for Speaker-independent Speech Separation",Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/605,"Recent deep learning methods have made significant progress in multi-talker mixed speech separation. However, most existing models adopt a driftless strategy to separate all the speech channels rather than selectively attend the target one. As a result, those frameworks may be failed to offer a satisfactory solution in complex auditory scene where the number of input sounds is usually uncertain and even dynamic. In this paper, we present a novel neural network based structure motivated by the top-down attention behavior of human when facing complicated acoustical scene. Different from previous works, our method constructs an inference-attention structure to predict interested candidates and extract each speech channel of them. Our work gets rid of the limitation that the number of channels must be given or the high computation complexity for label permutation problem. We evaluated our model on the WSJ0 mixed-speech tasks. In all the experiments, our model gets highly competitive to reach and even outperform the baselines."
66,Toward Diverse Text Generation with Inverse Reinforcement Learning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/606,"Text generation is a crucial task in NLP. Recently, several adversarial generative models have been proposed to improve the exposure bias problem in text generation. Though these models gain great success, they still suffer from the problems of reward sparsity and mode collapse. In order to address these two problems, in this paper, we employ inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for text generation. Specifically, the IRL framework learns a reward function on training data, and then an optimal policy to maximum the expected total reward. Similar to the adversarial models, the reward and policy function in IRL are optimized alternately. Our method has two advantages: (1)  the reward function can produce more dense reward signals. (2) the generation policy, trained by ``entropy regularized'' policy gradient,  encourages to generate more diversified texts. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate higher quality texts than the previous methods."
67,Complementary Learning of Word Embeddings,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/607,"Continuous bag-of-words (CB) and skip-gram (SG) models are popular approaches to training word embeddings. Conventionally they are two standing-alone techniques used individually. However, with the same goal of building embeddings by leveraging surrounding words, they are in fact a pair of complementary tasks where the output of one model can be used as input of the other, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose complementary learning of word embeddings based on the CB and SG model. Specifically, one round of learning first integrates the predicted output of a SG model with existing context, then forms an enlarged context as input to the CB model. Final models are obtained through several rounds of parameter updating. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively improve the quality of initial embeddings, in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations."

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely, ladder structured networks (LSN), which contains three layers representing word, character and radical and learns their embeddings synchronously. LSN captures not only the relations among words, but also the relations among their component characters and radicals, as well as the relations across layers. Each layer in LSN is pluggable so that any particular type of unit (word, character, radical) can be removed and the LSN is thus adjusted for particular types of inputs. In evaluating our framework, we use word similarity as the intrinsic evaluation and part-of-speech tagging and document classification as extrinsic evaluations. Experimental results confirm the validity of our approach and show superiority of our approach over previous work."
69,An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/609,"Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing. Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query ) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output. Experimental results show that such an ensemble system outperforms each single module by a large margin."

Given an entity pair and its sentence bag as input, in the encoder component, we employ the convolutional neural network to extract the features of the sentences in the sentence bag and merge them into a bag representation. In the decoder component, we utilize the long short-term memory network to model relation dependencies and predict the target relations in a sequential manner. In particular, to enable the sequential prediction of relations, we introduce a measure to quantify the amounts of information the relations take in their sentence bag, and use such information to determine the order of the relations of a sentence bag during model training. Moreover, we incorporate the attention mechanism into our model to dynamically adjust the bag representation to reduce the impact of sentences whose corresponding relations have been predicted. Extensive experiments on a popular dataset show that our model achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods."

Existing approaches have achieved promising results, however, they are still challenged by the lack of enough prior alignment as labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping approach to embedding-based entity alignment. It iteratively labels likely entity alignment as training data for learning alignment-oriented KG embeddings. Furthermore, it employs an alignment editing method to reduce error accumulation during iterations. Our experiments on real-world datasets showed that the proposed approach significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art embedding-based ones for entity alignment. The proposed alignment-oriented KG embedding, bootstrapping process and alignment editing method all contributed to the performance improvement."

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) method for topic segmentation and labeling in goal-oriented dialogues, which aims to detect topic boundaries among dialogue utterances and assign topic labels to the utterances. We address three common issues in the goal-oriented customer service dialogues: informality, local topic continuity, and global topic structure. We explore the task in a weakly supervised setting and formulate it as a sequential decision problem. The proposed method consists of a state representation network to address the informality issue, and a policy network with rewards to model local topic continuity and global topic structure. To train the two networks and offer a warm-start to the policy, we firstly use some keywords to annotate the data automatically. We then pre-train the networks on noisy data. Henceforth, the method continues to refine the data labels using the current policy to learn better state representations on the refined data for obtaining a better policy. Results demonstrate that this weakly supervised method obtains substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines."

In this paper, we propose the multiway attention networks which employ multiple attention functions to match sentence pairs under the matching-aggregation framework. Specifically, we design four attention functions to match words in corresponding sentences. Then, we aggregate the matching information from each function, and combine the information from all functions to obtain the final representation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multiway attention networks improve the result on the Quora Question Pairs, SNLI, MultiNLI, and answer sentence selection task on the SQuAD dataset."

However, previous research on neural generative dialogue systems always generates universal responses, and the attention distribution learned by the model always attends to the same semantic aspect. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (MHAM) for generative dialog systems, which aims at capturing multiple semantic aspects from the user utterance. Further, a regularizer is formulated to force different attention heads to concentrate on certain aspects. The proposed mechanism leads to more informative, diverse, and relevant response generated. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several strong baselines."
75,Hermitian Co-Attention Networks for Text Matching in Asymmetrical Domains,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/615,"Co-Attentions are highly effective attention mechanisms for text matching applications. Co-Attention enables the learning of pairwise attentions, i.e., learning to attend based on computing word-level affinity scores between two documents. However, text matching problems can exist in either symmetrical or asymmetrical domains. For example, paraphrase identification is a symmetrical task while question-answer matching and entailment classification are considered asymmetrical domains. In this paper, we argue that Co-Attention models in asymmetrical domains require different treatment as opposed to symmetrical domains, i.e., a concept of word-level directionality should be incorporated while learning word-level similarity scores. Hence, the standard inner product in real space commonly adopted in co-attention is not suitable. This paper leverages attractive properties of the complex vector space and proposes a co-attention mechanism based on the complex-valued inner product (Hermitian products). Unlike the real dot product, the dot product in complex space is asymmetric because the first item is conjugated. Aside from modeling and encoding directionality, our proposed approach also enhances the representation learning process. Extensive experiments on five text matching benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Recent work in neural network-based metrics has shown promising opportunities for automatic dialogue evaluation. However, existing methods mainly focus on monolingual evaluation, in which the trained metric is not flexible enough to transfer across different languages. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial multi-task neural metric (ADVMT) for multi-lingual dialogue evaluation, with shared feature extraction across languages. We evaluate the proposed model in two different languages. Experiments show that the adversarial multi-task neural metric achieves a high correlation with human annotation, which yields better performance than monolingual ones and various existing metrics."

Specifically, we first adopt sentence-level discourse segmentation to segment a sentence into several clauses. Then, we leverage multiple Bi-directional LSTM layers to encode all clauses and propose a word-level attention layer to capture the importance degrees of words in each clause. Third and finally, we leverage another Bi-directional LSTM layer to encode the outputs from the former layers and propose a clause-level attention layer to capture the importance degrees of all the clauses inside a sentence.

Recently, Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) has shown promising results in text generation. However, the texts generated by GAN usually suffer from the problems of poor quality, lack of diversity and mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework - SentiGAN, which has multiple generators and one multi-class discriminator, to address the above problems. In our framework, multiple generators are trained simultaneously, aiming at generating texts of different sentiment labels without supervision. We propose a penalty based objective in the generators to force each of them to generate diversified examples of a specific sentiment label. Moreover, the use of multiple generators and one multi-class discriminator can make each generator focus on generating its own examples of a specific sentiment label accurately. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art text generation methods in the sentiment accuracy and quality of generated texts."

Through jointly attending to topics and word-level alignment, our approach can improve coherence, diversity, and informativeness of generated summaries via a biased probability generation mechanism. On the other hand, reinforcement training, like SCST, directly optimizes the proposed model with respect to the non-differentiable metric ROUGE, which also avoids the exposure bias during inference. We carry out the experimental evaluation with state-of-the-art methods over the Gigaword, DUC-2004, and LCSTS datasets. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in the abstractive summarization."

Most existing neural joint methods extract entities and relations separately and achieve joint learning  through parameter sharing, leading to a drawback that information between output entities and relations cannot be fully exploited. In this paper, we convert the joint task into a directed graph by designing a novel graph scheme and propose a transition-based approach to generate the directed graph incrementally, which can achieve joint learning through joint decoding. Our method can model underlying dependencies not only between entities and relations, but also between relations. Experiments on NewYork Times (NYT) corpora show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

As a popular deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated great success in this task. However, most existing CNN models apply convolution filters of fixed window size, thereby unable to learn variable n-gram features flexibly. In this paper, we present a densely connected CNN with multi-scale feature attention for text classification. The dense connections build short-cut paths between upstream and downstream convolutional blocks, which enable the model to compose features of larger scale from those of smaller scale, and thus produce variable n-gram features. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature attention is developed to adaptively select multi-scale features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on five benchmark datasets. Attention visualization further reveals the model's ability to select proper n-gram features for text classification."

This task has been widely studied in some major languages, e.g., English, but was seldom addressed in other minor languages due to the lack of annotated corpus. To solve it, we develop a novel deep model to transfer knowledge from a source language with labeled training data to a target language without any annotations. Different from cross-lingual sentiment classification, aspect extraction across languages requires more fine-grained adaptation. To this end, we utilize transition-based mechanism that reads a word each time and forms a series of configurations that represent the status of the whole sentence. We represent each configuration as a continuous feature vector and align these representations from different languages into a shared space through an adversarial network. In addition, syntactic structures are also integrated into the deep model to achieve more syntactically-sensitive adaptations. The proposed method is end-to-end and achieves state-of-the-art performance on English, French and Spanish restaurant review datasets."
83,Quality Matters: Assessing cQA Pair Quality via Transductive Multi-View Learning,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/623,"Community-based question answering (cQA) sites have become important knowledge sharing platforms, as massive cQA pairs are archived, but the uneven quality of cQA pairs leaves information seekers unsatisfied. Various efforts have been dedicated to predicting the quality of cQA contents. Most of them concatenate different features into single vectors and then feed them into regression models. In fact, the quality of cQA pairs is influenced by different views, and the agreement among them is essential for quality assessment. Besides, the lacking of labeled data significantly hinders the quality prediction performance. Toward this end, we present a transductive multi-view learning model. It is designed to find a latent common space by unifying and preserving information from various views, including question, answer, QA relevance, asker, and answerer. Additionally, rich information in the unlabeled test cQA pairs are utilized via transductive learning to enhance the representation ability of the common space.

84,Instance Weighting with Applications to Cross-domain Text Classification via Trading off Sample Selection Bias and Variance,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/624,"Domain adaptation is an important problem in natural language processing (NLP) due to the distributional difference between the labeled source domain and the target domain. In this paper, we study the domain adaptation problem from the instance weighting perspective. By using density ratio as the instance weight, the traditional instance weighting approaches can potentially correct the sample selection bias in domain adaptation. However, researchers often failed to achieve good performance when applying instance weighting to domain adaptation in NLP and many negative results were reported in the literature. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study on the causes of the failure, and find that previous work only focused on reducing the sample selection bias, but ignored another important factor, sample selection variance, in domain adaptation. On this basis, we propose a new instance weighting framework by trading off two factors in instance weight learning. We evaluate our approach on two cross-domain text classification tasks and compare it with eight instance weighting methods. The results prove our approach's advantages in domain adaptation performance, optimization efficiency and parameter stability."

Our method fuses dynamic and static deviations to redistribute the sampling locations, which can capture both current and global transformations. Our modules can be easily integrated by other models to generate new transformable networks. We test proposed modules on two state-of-the-art models, and the results demonstrate that our modules can effectively adapt to the feature transformation in text classification."

General-purpose embeddings trained on large-scale corpora are often sub-optimal for domain-specific applications. However, domain-specific tasks often do not have large in-domain corpora for training high-quality domain embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel lifelong learning setting for domain embedding. That is, when performing the new domain embedding, the system has seen many past domains, and it tries to expand the new in-domain corpus by exploiting the corpora from the past domains via meta-learning. The proposed meta-learner characterizes the similarities of the contexts of the same word in many domain corpora, which helps retrieve relevant data from the past domains to expand the new domain corpus. Experimental results show that domain embeddings produced from such a process improve the performance of the downstream tasks."

To address this issue of different syntactics across different languages, we propose a model of bilingual word embeddings integrating syntactic dependencies (DepBiWE) by producing dependency parse-trees which encode the accurate relative positions for the contexts of aligned words. In addition, a new method is proposed to learn bilingual word embeddings from dependency-based contexts and BoW contexts jointly. Extensive experimental results on a real world dataset clearly validate the superiority of the proposed model DepBiWE on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks."

Specifically, our model first employs the recursive neural network LSTMs to embed each sentence. Then we import attention into LSTMs by considering that the words in a sentence do not contribute equally to the semantic meaning of the sentence. Next via adaptive boosting, we build strategically several such neural classifiers. By ensembling multiple such LSTM classifiers with adaptive boosting, we could build a more effective and robust joint ensemble neural networks based relation extractor.

This approach significantly improves the relevance of the generated poems by representing each line of the poem not only in a context-sensitive manner but also in a holistic way that is highly related to the given keyword and the learned topic.

Automatic poetry generation is an essential step towards computer creativity. In recent years, several neural models have been designed for this task. However, among lines of a whole poem, the coherence in meaning and topics still remains a big challenge. In this paper, inspired by the theoretical concept in cognitive psychology, we propose a novel Working Memory model for poetry generation. Different from previous methods, our model explicitly maintains topics and informative limited history in a neural memory. During the generation process, our model reads the most relevant parts from memory slots to generate the current line. After each line is generated, it writes the most salient parts of the previous line into memory slots. By dynamic manipulation of the memory, our model keeps a coherent information flow and learns to express each topic flexibly and naturally. We experiment on three different genres of Chinese poetry: quatrain, iambic and chinoiserie lyric. Both automatic and human evaluation results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."
94,Biased Random Walk based Social Regularization for Word Embeddings,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/634,"Nowadays, people publish a lot of natural language texts on social media. Socialized word embeddings (SWE) has been proposed to deal with two phenomena of language use: everyone has his/her own personal characteristics of language use and socially connected users are likely to use language in similar ways. We observe that the spread of language use is transitive.  Namely, one user can affect his/her friends and the friends can also affect their friends.  However, SWE modeled the transitivity implicitly. The social regularization in SWE only applies to one-hop neighbors and thus users outside the one-hop social circle will not be affected directly.  In this work, we adopt random walk methods to generate paths on the social graph to model the transitivity explicitly.  Each user on a path will be affected by his/her adjacent user(s) on the path. Moreover, according to the update mechanism of SWE, fewer friends a user has, fewer update opportunities he/she can get.  Hence, we propose a biased random walk method to provide these users with more update opportunities.   Experiments show that our random walk based social regularizations perform better on sentiment classification."
95,Reinforcing Coherence for Sequence to Sequence Model in Dialogue Generation,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/635,"Sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) approach has gained great attention in the field of single-turn dialogue generation. However, one serious problem is that most existing Seq2Seq based models tend to generate common responses lacking specific meanings. Our analysis show that the underlying reason is that Seq2Seq is equivalent to optimizing Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, thus does not penalize the case whose generated probability is high while the true probability is low. However, the true probability is unknown, which poses challenges for tackling this problem. Inspired by the fact that the coherence (i.e. similarity) between post and response is consistent with human evaluation, we hypothesize that the true probability of a response is proportional to the coherence degree. The coherence scores are then used as the reward function in a reinforcement learning framework to penalize the case whose generated probability is high while the true probability is low. Three different types of coherence models, including an unlearned similarity function, a pretrained semantic matching function, and an end-to-end dual learning architecture, are proposed in this paper. Experimental results on both Chinese Weibo dataset and English Subtitle dataset show that the proposed models produce more specific and meaningful responses, yielding better performances against Seq2Seq models in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations."

Moreover, a global regularization term is added to fulfill the spectrum energy preservation property regardless separation. Unlike state-of-the-art weakly supervised models which often involve deliberately devised constraints or careful model selection, our approach need little prior model specification on the data, and can be straightforwardly learned in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed method performs competitively on public benchmark against state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods."
97,Learning Tag Dependencies for Sequence Tagging,Main,"['Phonology, Morphology, and word segmentation', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/637,"Sequence tagging is the basis for multiple applications in natural language processing. Despite successes in learning long term token sequence dependencies with neural network, tag dependencies are rarely considered previously. Sequence tagging actually possesses complex dependencies and interactions among the input tokens and the output tags. We propose a novel multi-channel model, which handles different ranges of token-tag dependencies and their interactions simultaneously. A tag LSTM is augmented to manage the output tag dependencies and word-tag interactions, while three mechanisms are presented to efficiently incorporate token context representation and tag dependency. Extensive experiments on part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition tasks show that  the proposed model outperforms the BiLSTM-CRF baseline by effectively incorporating the tag dependency feature."
98,Towards Reading Comprehension for Long Documents,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering', 'Coreference Resolution']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/638,"Machine reading comprehension has gained attention from both industry and academia. It is a very challenging task that involves various domains such as language comprehension, knowledge inference, summarization, etc. Previous studies mainly focus on reading comprehension on short paragraphs, and these approaches fail to perform well on the documents. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical match attention model to instruct the machine to extract answers from a specific short span of passages for the long document reading comprehension (LDRC) task. The model takes advantages from hierarchical-LSTM to learn the paragraph-level representation, and implements the match mechanism (i.e., quantifying the relationship between two contexts) to find the most appropriate paragraph that includes the hint of answers. Then the task can be decoupled into reading comprehension task for short paragraph, such that the answer can be produced. Experiments on the modified SQuAD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms existing reading comprehension models by at least 20% regarding exact match (EM), F1 and the proportion of identified paragraphs which are exactly the short paragraphs where the original answers locate."
99,Text Emotion Distribution Learning via Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/639,"Emotion analysis of on-line user generated textual content is important for natural language processing and social media analytics tasks. Most of previous emotion analysis approaches focus on identifying users’ emotional states from text by classifying emotions into one of the finite categories, e.g., joy, surprise, anger and fear. However, there exists ambiguity characteristic for the emotion analysis, since a single sentence can evoke multiple emotions with different intensities. To address this problem, we introduce emotion distribution learning and propose a multi-task convolutional neural network for text emotion analysis. The end-to-end framework optimizes the distribution prediction and classification tasks simultaneously, which is able to learn robust representations for the distribution dataset with annotations of different voters. While most work adopt the majority voting scheme for the ground truth labeling, we also propose a lexiconbased strategy to generate distributions from a single label, which provides prior information for the emotion classification. Experiments conducted on five public text datasets (i.e., SemEval, Fairy Tales, ISEAR, TEC, CBET) demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches."
100,Neural Networks Incorporating Unlabeled and Partially-labeled Data for Cross-domain Chinese Word Segmentation,Main,"['Phonology, Morphology, and word segmentation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/640,"Most existing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) methods are usually supervised. Hence, large-scale annotated domain-specific datasets are needed for training. In this paper, we seek to address the problem of CWS for the resource-poor domains that lack annotated data. A novel neural network model is proposed to incorporate unlabeled and partially-labeled data. To make use of unlabeled data, we combine a bidirectional LSTM segmentation model with two character-level language models using a gate mechanism. These language models can capture co-occurrence information. To make use of partially-labeled data, we modify the original cross entropy loss function of RNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the method performs well on CWS tasks in a series of domains."
101,Phrase Table as Recommendation Memory for Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/641,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has drawn much attention due to its promising translation performance recently. However, several studies indicate that NMT often generates fluent but unfaithful translations. In this paper, we propose a method to alleviate this problem by using a phrase table as recommendation memory. The main idea is to add bonus to words worthy of recommendation, so that NMT can make correct predictions. Specifically, we first derive a prefix tree to accommodate all the candidate target phrases by searching the phrase translation table according to the source sentence.Then, we construct a recommendation word set by matching between candidate target phrases and previously translated target words by NMT. After that, we determine the specific bonus value for each recommendable word by using the attention vector and phrase translation probability. Finally,we integrate this bonus value into NMT to improve the translation results. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain remarkable improvements over the strong attention based NMT."
102,"Same Representation, Different Attentions: Shareable Sentence Representation Learning from Multiple Tasks",Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/642,"Distributed representation plays an important role in deep learning based natural language processing.   However, the representation of a sentence often varies in different tasks, which is usually learned from scratch and suffers from the limited amounts of training data. In this paper, we claim that a good sentence representation should be invariant and can benefit the various subsequent tasks. To achieve this purpose, we propose a new scheme of information sharing for multi-task learning. More specifically, all tasks share the same sentence representation and each task can select the task-specific information from the shared sentence representation with attention mechanisms. The query vector of each task's attention could be either static parameters or generated dynamically. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks, which demonstrate the benefits of our architecture. Source codes of this paper are available on Github."
103,Commonsense Knowledge Aware Conversation Generation with Graph Attention,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/643,"Commonsense knowledge is vital to many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present a novel open-domain conversation generation model to demonstrate how large-scale commonsense knowledge can facilitate language understanding and generation. Given a user post, the model retrieves relevant knowledge graphs from a knowledge base and then encodes the graphs with a static graph attention mechanism, which augments the semantic information of the post and thus supports better understanding of the post. Then, during word generation, the model attentively reads the retrieved knowledge graphs and the knowledge triples within each graph to facilitate better generation through a dynamic graph attention mechanism. This is the first attempt that uses large-scale commonsense knowledge in conversation generation. Furthermore, unlike existing models that use knowledge triples (entities) separately and independently, our model treats each knowledge graph as a whole, which encodes more structured, connected semantic information in the graphs. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate more appropriate and informative responses than state-of-the-art baselines."
104,Differentiated Attentive Representation Learning for Sentence Classification,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/644,"Attention-based models have shown to be effective in learning representations for sentence classification. They are typically equipped with multi-hop attention mechanism. However, existing multi-hop models still suffer from the problem of paying much attention to the most frequently noticed words, which might not be important to classify the current sentence. And there is a lack of explicitly effective way that helps the attention to be shifted out of a wrong part in the sentence. In this paper, we alleviate this problem by proposing a differentiated attentive learning model. It is composed of two branches of attention subnets and an example discriminator. An explicit signal with the loss information of the first attention subnet is passed on to the second one to drive them to learn different attentive preference. The example discriminator then selects the suitable attention subnet for sentence classification. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
105,Improving Information Extraction from Images with Learned Semantic Models,Best Sister Conferences,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/724,"Many applications require an understanding of an image that goes beyond the simple detection and classification of its objects. In particular, a great deal  of semantic information is carried in the relationships between objects. We have previously shown, that the combination of a visual model and a statistical semantic prior model can improve on the task of mapping images to their associated scene description. In this paper, we review the model and compare it to a novel conditional multi-way model for visual relationship detection, which does not include an explicitly trained visual prior model. We also discuss potential relationships between the proposed methods and memory models of the human brain."
106,Learning with Sparse and Biased Feedback for Personal Search,Best Sister Conferences,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/725,"Personal search, including email, on-device, and personal media search, has recently attracted a considerable attention from the information retrieval community. In this paper, we provide an overview of challenges and opportunities of learning with implicit user feedback (e.g., click data) in personal search. Implicit user feedback provides a convenient source of supervision for ranking models in personal search. This feedback, however, has two major drawbacks: it is highly sparse and biased due to the personal nature of queries and documents. We demonstrate how these drawbacks can be overcome, and empirically demonstrate the benefits of learning with implicit feedback in the context of a large-scale email search engine."
107,Accelerating Innovation Through Analogy Mining,Best Sister Conferences,"['Information Retrieval', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/736,"The availability of large idea repositories (e.g.,  patents) could significantly accelerate innovation and discovery by providing people inspiration from solutions to analogous problems. However, finding useful analogies in these large, messy, real-world repositories remains a persistent challenge for both humans and computers. Previous approaches include costly hand-created databases that do not scale, or machine-learning similarity metrics that struggle to account for structural similarity, which is central to analogy. In this paper we explore the viability and value of learning simple structural representations. Our approach combines crowdsourcing and recurrent neural networks to extract purpose and mechanism  vector representations from product descriptions. We demonstrate that these learned vectors allow us to find analogies with higher precision and recall than traditional methods. In an ideation experiment, analogies retrieved by our models significantly increased people's likelihood of generating creative ideas."
108,Unbiased Learning-to-Rank with Biased Feedback,Best Sister Conferences,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/738,"Implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell times, etc.) is an abundant source of data in human-interactive systems. While implicit feedback has many advantages (e.g., it is inexpensive to collect, user-centric, and timely), its inherent biases are a key obstacle to its effective use. For example, position bias in search rankings strongly influences how many clicks a result receives, so that directly using click data as a training signal in Learning-to-Rank (LTR) methods yields  sub-optimal results. To overcome this bias problem, we present a counterfactual inference framework that provides the theoretical basis for unbiased LTR via Empirical Risk Minimization despite biased data. Using this framework, we derive a propensity-weighted ranking SVM for discriminative learning from implicit feedback, where click models take the role of the propensity estimator.  Beyond the theoretical support, we show empirically that the proposed learning method is highly effective in dealing with biases, that it is robust to noise and propensity model mis-specification, and that it scales efficiently. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach on an operational search engine, where it substantially improves retrieval performance."
109,Evaluating and Complementing Vision-to-Language Technology for People who are Blind with Conversational Crowdsourcing,Best Sister Conferences,['Resources and Evaluation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/751,"We study how real-time crowdsourcing can be used both for evaluating the value provided by existing automated approaches and for enabling workflows that provide scalable and useful alt text to blind users. We show that the shortcomings of existing AI image captioning systems frequently hinder a user's understanding of an image they cannot see to a degree that even clarifying conversations with sighted assistants cannot correct. Based on analysis of clarifying conversations collected from our studies, we design experiences that can effectively assist users in a scalable way without the need for real-time interaction. Our results provide lessons and guidelines that the designers of future AI captioning systems can use to improve labeling of social media imagery for blind users."

111,A Conversational Approach to Process-oriented Case-based Reasoning,Best Sister Conferences,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/762,"Process-oriented case-based reasoning (POCBR) supports workflow modeling by retrieving and adapting workflows that have proved useful in the past. Current approaches typically require users to specify detailed queries, which can be a demanding task. Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) particularly addresses this problem by proposing methods that incrementally elicit the relevant features of the target problem in an interactive dialog. However, no CCBR approaches exist that are applicable for workflow cases that go beyond attribute-value representations such as labeled graphs. This paper closes this gap and presents a conversational POCBR approach (C-POCBR) in which questions related to structural properties of the workflow cases are generated automatically. An evaluation with cooking workflows indicates that C-POCBR can reduce the communication effort for users during retrieval."

Due to its promising potential and alluring commercial values to serve as virtual assistants and/or social chatbots, major AI, NLP, and Search & Mining conferences are explicitly calling-out for contributions from conversational studies. It is an active research area and of considerable interest. To build a conversational system with moderate intelligence is challenging, and requires abundant dialogue data and interdisciplinary techniques. Along with the Web 2.0, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversations. In general, conversational systems can be categorized into 1) task-oriented systems which aim to help users accomplish goals in vertical domains, and 2) social chat bots which can converse seamlessly and appropriately with humans, playing the role of a chat companion. In this paper, we focus on the survey of non-task-oriented chit-chat bots."
115,From Feature to Paradigm: Deep Learning in Machine Translation (Extended Abstract),Journal,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/789,"In the last years, deep learning algorithms have highly revolutionized several areas including speech, image and natural language processing. The specific field of Machine Translation (MT) has not remained invariant. Integration of deep learning in MT varies from re-modeling existing features into standard statistical systems to the development of a new architecture. Among the different neural networks, research works use feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks and the encoder-decoder schema. These architectures are able to tackle challenges as having low-resources or morphology variations. This extended abstract focuses on describing the foundational works on the neural MT approach; mentioning its strengths and weaknesses; and including an analysis of the corresponding challenges and future work. The full manuscript [Costa-jussà, 2018] describes, in addition, how these neural networks have been integrated to enhance different aspects and models from statistical MT, including language modeling, word alignment, translation, reordering, and rescoring; and on describing the new neural MT approach together with recent approaches on using subword, characters and training with multilingual languages, among others."

To this end, we define the artificial task of processing nested arithmetic expressions, and study whether different types of neural networks can learn to compute their meaning. We find that simple recurrent networks cannot find a generalising solution to this task, but gated recurrent neural networks perform surprisingly well: networks learn to predict the outcome of the arithmetic expressions with high accuracy, although performance deteriorates somewhat with increasing length. We test multiple hypotheses on the information that is encoded and processed by the networks using a method called diagnostic classification. In this method, simple neural classifiers are used to test sequences of predictions about features of the hidden state representations at each time step. Our results indicate that the networks follow a strategy similar to our hypothesised ‘cumulative strategy’, which explains the high accuracy of the network on novel expressions, the generalisation to longer expressions than seen in training, and the mild deterioration with increasing length. This, in turn, shows that diagnostic classifiers can be a useful technique for opening up the black box of neural networks."

This scenario is more and more frequent, given the large quantity of multilingual platforms and communities emerging on the Internet. In this work we analyse some important methods proposed in the literature that are machine-translation-free and dictionary-free, and we propose a particular configuration of the Random Indexing method (that we dub Lightweight Random Indexing). We show that it outperforms all compared algorithms and also displays a significantly reduced computational cost."

DCI derives term representations in a vector space common to both domains where each dimension reflects its distributional correspondence to a pivot, i.e., to a highly predictive term that behaves similarly across domains. The experiments we have conducted show that DCI obtains better performance than current state-of-the-art techniques for cross-lingual and cross-domain sentiment classification."

Differently from the past, where research on AI was mainly confined in research labs, the topic is now attracting interest from a wider audience, including policy-makers, information technology companies, and philosophers. Alas, these advances have also raised a number of concerns on AI’s social, economic, and legal impact. Hence, the definition of design principles and automated methods to support transparent intelligent machine deliberation is highly desirable. Argumentation is important for handling conflicting beliefs, assumptions, opinions, goals, and many other mental attitudes. Argumentation pervades human intelligent behavior, and I believe that it is a mandatory element to conceive autonomous artificial machines that can exploit argumentation models and tools in the cognitive tasks they are required to carry out. Results in this area will allow reducing the gap between humans and machines towards a good AI hybrid society."

Many approaches to improve the accuracy of ASR output exist. However, in the context of a domain and the environment in which a speaker speaks the sentences, gpASR output needs a lot of improvement in order to provide effective speech interfaces to domain-specific systems.

Our system explains algorithmic predictions with class-contrastive counterfactual statements (e.g., ``Had a number of conditions been different:...the prediction would change...''), which show a difference in a particular scenario that causes an algorithm to ``change its mind''. Such explanations do not require any prior technical knowledge to understand, hence are suitable for a lay audience, who interact with the system in a natural way -- through an interactive dialogue.
