0,Early Discovery of Emerging Entities in Microblogs,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/678,"Keeping up to date on emerging entities that appear every day is indispensable for various applications, such as social-trend analysis and marketing research. Previous studies have attempted to detect unseen entities that are not registered in a particular knowledge base as emerging entities and consequently find non-emerging entities since the absence of entities in knowledge bases does not guarantee their emergence. We therefore introduce a novel task of discovering truly emerging entities when they have just been introduced to the public through microblogs and propose an effective method based on time-sensitive distant supervision, which exploits distinctive early-stage contexts of emerging entities.  Experimental results with a large-scale Twitter archive show that the proposed method achieves 83.2% precision of the top 500 discovered emerging entities, which outperforms baselines based on unseen entity recognition with burst detection. Besides notable emerging entities, our method can discover massive long-tail and homographic emerging entities. An evaluation of relative recall shows that the method detects 80.4% emerging entities newly registered in Wikipedia; 92.8% of them are discovered earlier than their registration in Wikipedia, and the average lead-time is more than one year (578 days)."
1,Neural Program Induction for KBQA Without Gold Programs or Query Annotations,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/679,"Neural Program Induction (NPI) is a paradigm for decomposing high-level tasks such as complex question-answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) into executable programs by employing neural models. Typically, this involves two key phases: i) inferring input program variables from the high-level task description, and ii) generating the correct program sequence involving these variables. Here we focus on NPI for Complex KBQA with only the final answer as supervision, and not gold programs. This raises major challenges; namely, i) noisy query annotation in the absence of any supervision can lead to catastrophic forgetting while learning, ii) reward becomes extremely sparse owing to the noise. To deal with these, we propose a noise-resilient NPI model, Stable Sparse Reward based Programmer (SSRP) that evades noise-induced instability through continual retrospection and its comparison with current learning behavior. On complex KBQA datasets, SSRP performs at par with hand-crafted rule-based models when provided with gold program input, and in the noisy settings outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin even with a noisier query annotator."
2,Medical Concept Representation Learning from Multi-source Data,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/680,"Representing words as low dimensional vectors is very useful in many natural language processing tasks. This idea has been extended to medical domain where medical codes listed in medical claims are represented as vectors to facilitate exploratory analysis and predictive modeling. However, depending on a type of a medical provider, medical claims can use medical codes from different ontologies or from a combination of ontologies, which complicates learning of the representations.  To be able to properly utilize such multi-source medical claim data, we propose an approach that represents medical codes from different ontologies in the same vector space. We first modify the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measure of similarity between the codes. We then develop a new negative sampling method for word2vec model that implicitly factorizes the modified PMI matrix. The new approach was evaluated on the code cross-reference problem, which aims at identifying similar codes across different ontologies. In our experiments, we evaluated cross-referencing between ICD-9 and CPT medical code ontologies. Our results indicate that vector representations of codes learned by the proposed approach provide superior cross-referencing when compared to several existing approaches."
3,Multi-Domain Sentiment Classification Based on Domain-Aware Embedding and Attention,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/681,"Sentiment classification is a fundamental task in NLP. However, as revealed by many researches, sentiment classification models are highly domain-dependent. It is worth investigating to leverage data from different domains to improve the classification performance in each domain. In this work, we propose a novel completely-shared multi-domain neural sentiment classification model to learn domain-aware word embeddings and make use of domain-aware attention mechanism. Our model first utilizes BiLSTM for domain classification and extracts domain-specific features for words, which are then combined with general word embeddings to form domain-aware word embeddings. Domain-aware word embeddings are fed into another BiLSTM to extract sentence features. The domain-aware attention mechanism is used for selecting significant features, by using the domain-aware sentence representation as the query vector. Evaluation results on public datasets with 16 different domains demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. Further experiments show the generalization ability and the transferability of our model."
4,A Latent Variable Model for Learning Distributional Relation Vectors,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/682,"Recently a number of unsupervised approaches have been proposed for learning vectors that capture the relationship between two words. Inspired by word embedding models, these approaches rely on co-occurrence statistics that are obtained from sentences in which the two target words appear. However, the number of such sentences is often quite small, and most of the words that occur in them are not relevant for characterizing the considered relationship. As a result, standard co-occurrence statistics typically lead to noisy relation vectors. To address this issue, we propose a latent variable model that aims to explicitly determine what words from the given sentences best characterize the relationship between the two target words. Relation vectors then correspond to the parameters of a simple unigram language model which is estimated from these words."
5,Generating Multiple Diverse Responses with Multi-Mapping and Posterior Mapping Selection,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/683,"In human conversation an input post is open to multiple potential responses, which is typically regarded as a one-to-many problem. Promising approaches mainly incorporate multiple latent mechanisms to build the one-to-many relationship. However, without accurate selection of the latent mechanism corresponding to the target response during training, these methods suffer from a rough optimization of latent mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a multi-mapping mechanism to better capture the one-to-many relationship, where multiple mapping modules are employed as latent mechanisms to model the semantic mappings from an input post to its diverse responses. For accurate optimization of latent mechanisms, a posterior mapping selection module is designed to select the corresponding mapping module according to the target response for further optimization. We also introduce an auxiliary matching loss to facilitate the optimization of posterior mapping selection. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating multiple diverse and informative responses over the state-of-the-art methods."
6,Sentiment-Controllable Chinese Poetry Generation,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/684,"Expressing diverse sentiments is one of the main purposes of human poetry creation. Existing Chinese poetry generation models have made great progress in poetry quality, but they all neglected to endow generated poems with specific sentiments. Such defect leads to strong sentiment collapse or bias and thus hurts the diversity and semantics of generated poems. Meanwhile, there are few sentimental Chinese poetry resources for studying. To address this problem, we first collect a manually-labelled sentimental poetry corpus with fine-grained sentiment labels. Then we propose a novel semi-supervised conditional Variational Auto-Encoder model for sentiment-controllable poetry generation. Besides, since poetry is discourse-level text where the polarity and intensity of sentiment could transfer among lines, we incorporate a temporal module to capture sentiment transition patterns among different lines. Experimental results show our model can control the sentiment of not only a whole poem but also each line, and improve the poetry diversity against the state-of-the-art models without losing quality."
7,From Words to Sentences: A Progressive Learning Approach for Zero-resource Machine Translation with Visual Pivots,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/685,"The neural machine translation model has suffered from the lack of large-scale parallel corpora. In contrast, we humans can learn multi-lingual translations even without parallel texts by referring our languages to the external world. To mimic such human learning behavior, we employ images as pivots to enable zero-resource translation learning. However, a picture tells a thousand words, which makes multi-lingual sentences pivoted by the same image noisy as mutual translations and thus hinders the translation model learning. In this work, we propose a progressive learning approach for image-pivoted zero-resource machine translation. Since words are less diverse when grounded in the image, we first learn word-level translation with image pivots, and then progress to learn the sentence-level translation by utilizing the learned word translation to suppress noises in image-pivoted multi-lingual sentences. Experimental results on two widely used image-pivot translation datasets, IAPR-TC12 and Multi30k, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."
8,Learning towards Abstractive Timeline Summarization,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Summarization']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/686,"Timeline summarization targets at concisely summarizing the evolution trajectory along the timeline and existing timeline summarization approaches are all based on extractive methods.In this paper, we propose the task of abstractive timeline summarization, which tends to concisely paraphrase the information in the time-stamped events.Unlike traditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the time series information of the input events and summarize important events in chronological order.To tackle this challenge, we propose a memory-based timeline summarization model (MTS).Concretely, we propose a time-event memory to establish a timeline, and use the time position of events on this timeline to guide generation process.Besides, in each decoding step, we incorporate event-level information into word-level attention to avoid confusion between events.Extensive experiments are conducted on a large-scale real-world dataset, and the results show that MTS achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluations."
9,Coreference Aware Representation Learning for Neural Named Entity Recognition,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/687,"Recent neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the task of named entity recognition (NER).  However, previous neural network models typically treat the input sentences as a linear sequence of words but ignore rich structural information, such as the coreference relations among non-adjacent words, phrases or entities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn coreference-aware word representations for the NER task at the document level. In particular, we enrich the well-known neural architecture ``CNN-BiLSTM-CRF'' with a coreference layer on top of the BiLSTM layer to incorporate coreferential relations. Furthermore, we introduce the coreference regularization to ensure the coreferential entities to share similar representations and consistent predictions within the same coreference cluster. Our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two NER benchmarks: CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes v5.0. More importantly, we demonstrate that our framework does not rely on gold coreference knowledge, and can still work well even when the coreferential relations are generated by a third-party toolkit."
10,Learning  Assistance from an Adversarial Critic for Multi-Outputs Prediction,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/688,"We introduce an adversarial-critic-and-assistant (ACA) learning framework to improve the performance of existing supervised learning with multiple outputs.  The core contribution of our ACA is  the innovation of two novel modules, i.e. an  `adversarial critic'  and a `collaborative assistant', that are jointly designed to provide  augmenting information for facilitating general learning tasks. Our approach is not intended to be regarded as an emerging competitor for tons of  well-established algorithms in the field. In fact, most existing approaches, while implemented with different learning objectives, can all be adopted as building blocks seamlessly integrated in the ACA framework to accomplish various real-world tasks. We show the performance and generalization ability of ACA on diverse learning tasks including multi-label classification, attributes prediction and sequence-to-sequence generation."
11,End-to-End Multi-Perspective Matching for Entity Resolution,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Coreference Resolution']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/689,"Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify data records referring to the same real-world entity. Due to the heterogeneity of entity attributes and the diversity of similarity measures, one main challenge of ER is how to select appropriate similarity measures for different attributes. Previous ER methods usually employ heuristic similarity selection algorithms, which are highly specialized to specific ER problems and are hard to be generalized to other situations. Furthermore, previous studies usually perform similarity learning and similarity selection independently, which often result in error propagation and are hard to be optimized globally. To resolve the above problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-perspective entity matching model, which can adaptively select optimal similarity measures for heterogenous attributes by jointly learning and selecting similarity measures in an end-to-end way. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms previous ER methods."
12,Difficulty Controllable Generation of Reading Comprehension Questions,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Question Answering', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/690,"We investigate the difficulty levels of questions in reading comprehension datasets such as SQuAD, and propose a new question generation setting, named Difficulty-controllable Question Generation (DQG). Taking as input a sentence in the reading comprehension paragraph and some of its text fragments (i.e., answers) that we want to ask questions about, a DQG method needs to generate questions each of which has a given text fragment as its answer, and meanwhile the generation is under the control of specified difficulty labels---the output questions should satisfy the specified difficulty as much as possible. To solve this task, we propose an end-to-end framework to generate questions of designated difficulty levels by exploring a few important intuitions. For evaluation, we prepared the first dataset of reading comprehension questions with difficulty labels. The results show that the question generated by our framework not only have better quality under the metrics like BLEU, but also comply with the specified difficulty labels."
13,Modeling Source Syntax and Semantics for Neural AMR Parsing,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/691,"Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approaches formalize Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing as a translation task from a source sentence to a target AMR graph. However, previous studies generally model a source sentence as a word sequence but ignore the inherent syntactic and semantic information in the sentence. In this paper, we propose two effective approaches to explicitly modeling source syntax and semantics into neural seq2seq AMR parsing. The first approach linearizes source syntactic and semantic structure into a mixed sequence of words, syntactic labels, and semantic labels, while in the second approach we propose a syntactic and semantic structure-aware encoding scheme through a self-attentive model to explicitly capture syntactic and semantic relations between words. Experimental results on an English benchmark dataset show that our two approaches achieve significant improvement of 3.1% and 3.4% F1 scores over a strong seq2seq baseline."
14,CNN-Based Chinese NER with Lexicon Rethinking,Main,"['Named Entities', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing', 'Phonology, Morphology, and word segmentation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/692,"Character-level Chinese named entity recognition (NER) that applies long short-term memory (LSTM) to incorporate lexicons has achieved great success. However, this method fails to fully exploit GPU parallelism and candidate lexicons can conflict. In this work, we propose a faster alternative to Chinese NER: a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method that incorporates lexicons using a rethinking mechanism. The proposed method can model all the characters and potential words that match the sentence in parallel. In addition, the rethinking mechanism can address the word conflict by feeding back the high-level features to refine the networks. Experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than both word-level and character-level baseline methods. In addition, the proposed method performs up to 3.21 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, while realizing better performance."
15,Dual Visual Attention Network for Visual Dialog,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/693,"Visual dialog is a challenging task, which involves multi-round semantic transformations between vision and language. This paper aims to address cross-modal semantic correlation for visual dialog. Motivated by that Vg (global vision), Vl (local vision), Q (question) and H (history) have inseparable relevances, the paper proposes a novel Dual Visual Attention Network (DVAN) to realize (Vg, Vl, Q, H)--> A. DVAN is a three-stage query-adaptive attention model. In order to acquire accurate A (answer), it first explores the textual attention, which imposes the question on history to pick out related context H'. Then, based on Q and H', it implements respective visual attentions to discover related global image visual hints Vg' and local object-based visual hints Vl'. Next, a dual crossing visual attention is proposed. Vg' and Vl' are mutually embedded to learn the complementary of visual semantics. Finally, the attended textual and visual features are combined to infer the answer. Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
16,AmazonQA: A Review-Based Question Answering Task,Main,"['Question Answering', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/694,"Every day, thousands of customers post questions on Amazon product pages. After some time, if they are fortunate, a knowledgeable customer might answer their question. Observing that many questions can be answered based upon the available product reviews, we propose the task of review-based QA. Given a corpus of reviews and a question, the QA system synthesizes an answer. To this end, we introduce a new dataset and propose a method that combines informational retrieval techniques for selecting relevant reviews (given a question) and ""reading comprehension"" models for synthesizing an answer (given a question and review). Our dataset consists of 923k questions, 3.6M answers and 14M reviews across 156k products. Building on the well-known Amazon dataset, we additionally collect annotations marking each question as either answerable or unanswerable based on the available reviews. A deployed system could first classify a question as answerable before attempting to generate a provisional answer. Notably, unlike many popular QA datasets, here the questions, passages, and answers are extracted from real human interactions. We evaluate a number of models for answer generation and propose strong baselines, demonstrating the challenging nature of this new task."
17,Answering Binary Causal Questions Through Large-Scale Text Mining: An Evaluation Using Cause-Effect Pairs from Human Experts,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/695,"In this paper, we study the problem of answering questions of type ""Could X cause Y?"" where X and Y are general phrases without any constraints. Answering such questions will assist with various decision analysis tasks such as verifying and extending presumed causal associations used for decision making. Our goal is to analyze the ability of an AI agent built using state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in answering causal questions derived from collections of cause-effect pairs from human experts. We focus only on unsupervised and weakly supervised methods due to the difficulty of creating a large enough training set with a reasonable quality and coverage. The methods we examine rely on a large corpus of text derived from news articles, and include methods ranging from large-scale application of classic NLP techniques and statistical analysis to the use of neural network based phrase embeddings and state-of-the-art neural language models."
18,GSN: A Graph-Structured Network for Multi-Party Dialogues,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/696,"Existing neural models for dialogue response generation assume that utterances are sequentially organized. However, many real-world dialogues involve multiple interlocutors (i.e., multi-party dialogues), where the assumption does not hold as utterances from different interlocutors can occur ``in parallel.'' This paper generalizes existing sequence-based models to a Graph-Structured neural Network (GSN) for dialogue modeling. The core of GSN is a graph-based encoder that can model the information flow along the graph-structured dialogues (two-party sequential dialogues are a special case). Experimental results show that GSN significantly outperforms existing sequence-based models."
19,Leap-LSTM: Enhancing Long Short-Term Memory for Text Categorization,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/697,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in the field of natural language processing (NLP), ranging from text categorization to question answering and machine translation. However, RNNs generally read the whole text from beginning to end or vice versa sometimes, which makes it inefficient to process long texts. When reading a long document for a categorization task, such as topic categorization, large quantities of words are irrelevant and can be skipped. To this end, we propose  Leap-LSTM, an LSTM-enhanced model which dynamically leaps between words while reading texts.  At each step, we utilize several feature encoders to extract messages from preceding texts, following texts and the current word, and then determine whether to skip the current word. We evaluate Leap-LSTM on several text categorization tasks: sentiment analysis, news categorization, ontology classification and topic classification, with five benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that our model reads faster and predicts better than standard LSTM. Compared to previous models which can also skip words, our model achieves better trade-offs between performance and efficiency."
20,Relation Extraction Using Supervision from Topic Knowledge of Relation Labels,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/698,"Explicitly exploring the semantics of a relation is significant for high-accuracy relation extraction, which is, however, not fully studied in previous work. In this paper, we mine the topic knowledge of a relation to explicitly represent the semantics of this relation, and model relation extraction as a matching problem. That is, the matching score between a sentence and a candidate relation is predicted for an entity pair. To this end, we propose a deep matching network to precisely model the semantic similarity between a sentence-relation pair. Besides, the topic knowledge also allows us to derive the importance information of samples as well as two knowledge-guided negative sampling strategies in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed framework and observe improvements in AUC of 11.5% and max F1 of 5.4% over the baselines with state-of-the-art performance."
21,Representation Learning with Weighted Inner Product for Universal Approximation of General Similarities,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/699,"We propose weighted inner product similarity (WIPS) for neural network-based graph embedding. In addition to the parameters of neural networks, we optimize the weights of the inner product by allowing positive and negative values. Despite its simplicity, WIPS can approximate arbitrary general similarities including positive definite, conditionally positive definite, and indefinite kernels. WIPS is free from similarity model selection, since it can learn any similarity models such as cosine similarity, negative Poincaré distance and negative Wasserstein distance. Our experiments show that the proposed method can learn high-quality distributed representations of nodes from real datasets, leading to an accurate approximation of similarities as well as high performance in inductive tasks."
22,Incorporating Structural Information for Better Coreference Resolution,Main,"['Discourse', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/700,"Coreference resolution plays an important role in text understanding. In the literature, various neural approaches have been proposed and achieved considerable success. However, structural information, which has been proven useful in coreference resolution, has been largely ignored in previous neural approaches. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating structural information to neural coreference resolution from three aspects. Firstly, nodes in the parse trees are employed as a constraint to filter out impossible text spans (i.e., mention candidates) in reducing the computational complexity. Secondly, contextual information is encoded in the traversal node sequence instead of the word sequence to better capture hierarchical information for text span representation. Lastly, additional structural features (e.g., the path, siblings, degrees, category of the current node) are encoded to enhance the mention representation. Experimentation on the data-set of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach in incorporating structural information into neural coreference resolution."
23,Knowledge Base Question Answering with Topic Units,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/701,"Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is an important task in natural language processing. Existing methods for KBQA usually start with entity linking, which considers mostly named entities found in a question as the starting points in the KB to search for answers to the question. However, relying only on entity linking to look for answer candidates may not be sufficient. In this paper, we propose to perform topic unit linking where topic units cover a wider range of units of a KB. We use a generation-and-scoring approach to gradually refine the set of topic units. Furthermore, we use reinforcement learning to jointly learn the parameters for topic unit linking and answer candidate ranking in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on three commonly used benchmark datasets show that our method consistently works well and outperforms the previous state of the art on two datasets."
24,Adversarial Transfer for  Named Entity Boundary Detection with Pointer Networks,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/702,"In this paper, we focus on named entity boundary detection, which aims to detect the start and end boundaries of an entity mention in text, without predicting its type. A more accurate and robust detection approach is desired to alleviate error propagation in downstream applications, such as entity linking and fine-grained typing systems. Here, we first develop a novel entity boundary labeling approach with pointer networks, where the output dictionary size depends on the input, which is variable. Furthermore, we propose AT-Bdry, which incorporates adversarial transfer learning into an end-to-end sequence labeling model to encourage domain-invariant representations. More importantly, AT-Bdry can reduce domain difference in data distributions between the source and target domains, via an unsupervised transfer learning approach (i.e., no annotated target-domain data is necessary). We conduct Formal Text to Formal Text, Formal Text to Informal Text and ablation evaluations on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AT-Bdry achieves state-of-the-art transferring performance against recent baselines."
25,Towards Discriminative Representation Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,Main,"['Speech', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/703,"In intelligent speech interaction, automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in understanding user intention.  While sentimental speech has different speaker characteristics but similar acoustic attributes, one vital challenge in SER is how to learn robust and discriminative representations for emotion inferring.  In this paper, inspired by human emotion perception, we propose a novel representation learning component (RLC) for SER system, which is constructed with Multi-head Self-attention and Global Context-aware Attention Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neutral Network (GCA-LSTM). With the ability of Multi-head Self-attention mechanism in modeling the element-wise correlative dependencies, RLC can exploit the common patterns of sentimental speech features to enhance emotion-salient information importing in representation learning. By employing GCA-LSTM, RLC can selectively focus on emotion-salient factors with the consideration of entire utterance context, and gradually produce discriminative representation for emotion inferring.  Experiments on public emotional benchmark database IEMOCAP and a tremendous realistic interaction database demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed SER framework, with 6.6% to 26.7% relative improvement on unweighted accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques."

Based on the detailed error analysis, we then combine the power of both BiLSTM and self-attention via model ensembles, demonstrating their complementary capability of capturing contextual information. Finally, we explore the recently proposed contextualized word representations as extra input features, and further improve the parsing performance."
27,Reading selectively via Binary Input Gated Recurrent Unit,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/705,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown great promise in sequence modeling tasks. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is one of the most used recurrent structures, which makes a good trade-off between performance and time spent. However, its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves the goal to control information flow. We can hardly explain what the network has learnt internally. Inspired by human reading, we introduce binary input gated recurrent unit (BIGRU), a GRU based model using a binary input gate instead of the reset gate in GRU. By doing so, our model can read selectively during interference. In our experiments, we show that BIGRU mainly ignores the conjunctions, adverbs and articles that do not make a big difference to the document understanding, which is meaningful for us to further understand how the network works. In addition, due to reduced interference from redundant information, our model achieves better performances than baseline GRU in all the testing tasks."
28,Learning to Select Knowledge for Response Generation in Dialog Systems,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/706,"End-to-end neural models for intelligent dialogue systems suffer from the problem of generating uninformative responses. Various methods were proposed to generate more informative responses by leveraging external knowledge. However,  few previous work has focused on selecting appropriate knowledge in the learning process. The inappropriate selection of knowledge could prohibit the model from learning to make full use of the knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose an end-to-end neural model which employs a novel knowledge selection mechanism where both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge are used to facilitate knowledge selection. Specifically, a posterior distribution over knowledge is inferred from both utterances and responses, and it ensures the appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process. Meanwhile, a prior distribution, which is inferred from utterances only,  is used to approximate the posterior distribution so that appropriate knowledge can be selected even without responses during the inference process. Compared with the previous work, our model can better incorporate appropriate knowledge in response generation. Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the superiority of our model over previous baselines."
29,Deep Mask Memory Network with Semantic Dependency and Context Moment for Aspect Level Sentiment Classification,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/707,"Aspect level sentiment classification aims at identifying the sentiment of each aspect term in a sentence. Deep memory networks often use location information between context word and aspect to generate the memory. Although improved results are achieved, the relation information among aspects in the same sentence is ignored and the word location can't bring enough and accurate information for the analysis on the aspect sentiment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect level sentiment classification, deep mask memory network with semantic dependency and context moment (DMMN-SDCM), which integrates semantic parsing information of the aspect and the inter-aspect relation information into deep memory network. With the designed attention mechanism based on semantic dependency information, different parts of the context memory in different computational layers are selected and useful inter-aspect information in the same sentence is exploited for the desired aspect. To make full use of the inter-aspect relation information, we also jointly learn a context moment learning task, which aims to learn the sentiment distribution of the entire sentence for providing a background for the desired aspect. We examined the merit of our model on SemEval 2014 Datasets, and the experimental results show that our model achieves a state-of-the-art performance."
30,Exploring and Distilling Cross-Modal Information for Image Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/708,"Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder models have been used extensively in image captioning. Yet there is still great difficulty for the current methods to achieve deep image understanding. In this work, we argue that such understanding requires visual attention to correlated image regions and semantic attention to coherent attributes of interest. To perform effective attention, we explore image captioning from a cross-modal perspective and propose the Global-and-Local Information Exploring-and-Distilling approach that explores and distills the source information in vision and language. It globally provides the aspect vector, a spatial and relational representation of images based on caption contexts, through the extraction of salient region groupings and attribute collocations, and locally extracts the fine-grained regions and attributes in reference to the aspect vector for word selection. Our fully-attentive model achieves a CIDEr score of 129.3 in offline COCO evaluation with remarkable efficiency in terms of accuracy, speed, and parameter budget."
31,Network Embedding with Dual Generation Tasks,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/709,"We study the problem of Network Embedding (NE) for content-rich networks. NE models aim to learn efficient low-dimensional dense vectors for network vertices which are crucial to many network analysis tasks. The core problem of content-rich network embedding is to learn and integrate the semantic information conveyed by network structure and node content. In this paper, we propose a general end-to-end model, Dual GEnerative Network Embedding (DGENE), to leverage the complementary information of network structure and content. In this model, each vertex is regarded as an object with two modalities: node identity and textual content. Then we formulate two dual generation tasks. One is Node Identification (NI) which recognizes nodes’ identities given their contents. Inversely, the other one is Content Generation (CG) which generates textual contents given the nodes’ identities. We develop specific Content2Node and Node2Content models for the two tasks. Under the DGENE framework, the two dual models are learned by sharing and integrating intermediate layers, with which they mutually enhance each other. Extensive experimental results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art NE methods. Moreover, our model has an interesting and useful byproduct, that is, a component of our model can generate texts, which is potentially useful for many tasks."
32,Building Personalized Simulator for Interactive Search,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/710,"Interactive search, where a set of tags is recommended to users together with search results at each turn, is an effective way to guide users to identify their information need. It is a classical sequential decision problem and the reinforcement learning based agent can be introduced as a solution. The training of the agent can be divided into two stages, i.e., offline and online. Existing reinforcement learning based systems tend to perform the offline training in a supervised way based on historical labeled data while the online training is performed via reinforcement learning algorithms based on interactions with real users. The mis-match between online and offline training leads to a cold-start problem for the online usage of the agent. To address this issue, we propose to employ a simulator to mimic the environment for the offline training of the agent. Users' profiles are considered to build a personalized simulator, besides, model-based approach is used to train the simulator and is able to use the data efficiently. Experimental results based on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our agent and personalized simulator."
33,A Dual Reinforcement Learning Framework for Unsupervised Text Style Transfer,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/711,"Unsupervised text style transfer aims to transfer the underlying style of text but keep its main content unchanged without parallel data. Most existing methods typically follow two steps: first separating the content from the original style, and then fusing the content with the desired style. However, the separation in the first step is challenging because the content and style interact in subtle ways in natural language. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual reinforcement learning framework to directly transfer the style of the text via a one-step mapping model, without any separation of content and style. Specifically, we consider the learning of the source-to-target and target-to-source mappings as a dual task, and two rewards are designed based on such a dual structure to reflect the style accuracy and content preservation, respectively. In this way, the two one-step mapping models can be trained via reinforcement learning, without any use of parallel data. Automatic evaluations show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, especially with more than 10 BLEU points improvement averaged on two benchmark datasets. Human evaluations also validate the effectiveness of our model in terms of style accuracy, content preservation and fluency. Our code and data, including outputs of all baselines and our model are available at https://github.com/luofuli/DualRL."
34,Unsupervised Neural Aspect Extraction with Sememes,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/712,"Aspect extraction relies on identifying aspects by discovering coherence among words, which is challenging when word meanings are diversified and processing on short texts. To enhance the performance on aspect extraction, leveraging lexical semantic resources is a possible solution to such challenge. In this paper, we present an unsupervised neural framework that leverages sememes to enhance lexical semantics. The overall framework is analogous to an autoenoder which reconstructs sentence representations and learns aspects by latent variables. Two models that form sentence representations are proposed by exploiting sememes via (1) a hierarchical attention; (2) a context-enhanced attention. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of our models, which significantly outperforms existing baselines."
35,Randomized Greedy Search for Structured Prediction: Amortized Inference and Learning,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/713,"In a structured prediction problem, we need to learn a predictor that can produce a structured output given a structured input (e.g., part-of-speech tagging). The key learning and inference challenge is due to the exponential size of the structured output space. This paper makes four contributions towards the goal of a computationally-efficient inference and training approach for structured prediction that allows to employ complex models and to optimize for non-decomposable loss functions. First, we define a simple class of randomized greedy search (RGS) based inference procedures that leverage classification algorithms for simple outputs. Second, we develop a RGS specific learning approach for amortized inference that can quickly produce high-quality outputs for a given set of structured inputs. Third, we plug our amortized RGS inference solver inside the inner loop of parameter-learning algorithms (e.g., structured SVM) to improve the speed of training. Fourth, we perform extensive experiments on diverse structured prediction tasks. Results show that our proposed approach is competitive or better than many state-of-the-art approaches in spite of its simplicity."
36,Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification with Attentive Neural Turing Machines,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/714,"Aspect-based sentiment classification aims to identify sentiment polarity expressed towards a given opinion target in a sentence. The sentiment polarity of the target is not only highly determined by sentiment semantic context but also correlated with the concerned opinion target.  Existing works cannot effectively capture and store the inter-dependence between the opinion target and its context. To solve this issue, we propose a novel model of Attentive Neural Turing Machines (ANTM).  Via interactive read-write operations between an external memory storage and a recurrent controller, ANTM can learn the dependable correlation of the opinion target to context and concentrate on crucial sentiment information. Specifically, ANTM separates the information of storage and computation, which extends the capabilities of the controller to learn and store sequential features.  The read and write operations enable ANTM to adaptively keep track of the interactive attention history between memory content and controller state. Moreover, we append target entity embeddings into both input and output of the controller in order to augment the integration of target information.  We evaluate our model on SemEval2014 dataset which contains reviews of Laptop and Restaurant domains and Twitter review dataset.  Experimental results verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on aspect-based sentiment classification."

However, representations of unseen or rare words trained on the end task are usually poor for appreciable performance. This is commonly referred to as the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. In this work, we address the OOV problem in sequence labeling using only training data of the task. To this end, we propose a novel method to predict representations for OOV words from their surface-forms (e.g., character sequence) and contexts. The method is specifically designed to avoid the error propagation problem suffered by existing approaches in the same paradigm. To evaluate its effectiveness, we performed extensive empirical studies on four part-of-speech tagging (POS) tasks and four named entity recognition (NER) tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better or competitive performance on the OOV problem compared with existing state-of-the-art methods."
38,Improving Cross-Domain Performance for Relation Extraction via Dependency Prediction and Information Flow Control,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/716,Relation Extraction (RE) is one of the fundamental tasks in Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing. Dependency trees have been shown to be a very useful source of information for this task. The current deep learning models for relation extraction has mainly exploited this dependency information by guiding their computation along the structures of the dependency trees. One potential problem with this approach is it might prevent the models from capturing important context information beyond syntactic structures and cause the poor cross-domain generalization. This paper introduces a novel method to use dependency trees in RE for deep learning models that jointly predicts dependency and semantics relations. We also propose a new mechanism to control the information flow in the model based on the input entity mentions. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods for RE significantly.
39,Learn to Select via Hierarchical Gate Mechanism for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/717,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model armed with attention mechanism seems a natural fit for this task, and actually it achieves the state-of-the-art performance recently. However, previous attention mechanisms proposed for ABSA may attend irrelevant words and thus downgrade the performance, especially when dealing with long and complex sentences with multiple aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Hierarchical Gate Memory Network (HGMN) for ABSA: firstly, we employ the proposed hierarchical gate mechanism to learn to select the related part about the given aspect, which can keep the original sequence structure of sentence at the same time. After that, we apply Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the final aspect-specific memory. We conduct extensive experiments on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter dataset, and results demonstrate that our model outperforms attention based state-of-the-art baselines."
40,Aligning Learning Outcomes to Learning Resources: A Lexico-Semantic Spatial Approach,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/718,"Aligning Learning Outcomes (LO) to relevant portions of Learning Resources (LR) is necessary to help students quickly navigate within the recommended learning material. In general, the problem can be viewed as finding the relevant sections of a document (LR) that is pertinent to a broad question (LO). In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of aligning LOs (LO is usually a sentence long text) to relevant pages of LRs (LRs are in the form of slide decks). We observe that the set of relevant pages can be composed of multiple chunks (a chunk is a contiguous set of pages) and the same page of an LR might be relevant to multiple LOs. To this end, we develop a novel Lexico-Semantic Spatial approach that captures the lexical, semantic, and spatial aspects of the task, and also alleviates the limited availability of training data. Our approach first identifies the relevancy of a page to an LO by using lexical and semantic features from each page independently. The spatial model at a later stage exploits the dependencies between the sequence of pages in the LR to further improve the alignment task. We empirically establish the importance of the lexical, semantic, and spatial models within the proposed approach. We show that, on average, a student can navigate to a relevant page from the first predicted page by about four clicks within a 38 page slide deck, as compared to two clicks by human experts."
41,A Deep Generative Model for Code Switched Text,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/719,"Code-switching, the interleaving of two or more languages within a sentence or discourse is pervasive in multilingual societies. Accurate language models for code-switched text are critical for NLP tasks. State-of-the-art data-intensive neural language models are difficult to train well from scarce language-labeled code-switched text. A potential solution is to use deep generative models to synthesize large volumes of realistic code-switched text. Although generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders can synthesize plausible monolingual text from continuous latent space, they cannot adequately address code-switched text, owing to their informal style and complex interplay between the constituent languages. We introduce VACS, a novel variational autoencoder architecture specifically tailored to code-switching phenomena. VACS encodes to and decodes from a two-level hierarchical representation, which models syntactic contextual signals in the lower level, and language switching signals in the upper layer. Sampling representations from the prior and decoding them produced well-formed, diverse code-switched sentences. Extensive experiments show that using synthetic code-switched text with natural monolingual data results in significant (33.06\%) drop in perplexity."
42,Knowledge Aware Semantic Concept Expansion for Image-Text Matching,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/720,"Image-text matching is a vital cross-modality task in artificial intelligence and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing works have shown that learning semantic concepts is useful to enhance image representation and can significantly improve the performance of both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval. However, existing models simply detect semantic concepts from a given image, which are less likely to deal with long-tail and occlusion concepts. Frequently co-occurred concepts in the same scene, e.g. bedroom and bed, can provide common-sense knowledge to discover other semantic-related concepts.  In this paper, we develop a Scene Concept Graph (SCG) by aggregating image scene graphs and extracting frequently co-occurred concept pairs as scene common-sense knowledge. Moreover, we propose a novel model to incorporate this knowledge to improve image-text matching. Specifically, semantic concepts are detected from images and then expanded by the SCG. After learning to select relevant contextual concepts, we fuse their representations with the image embedding feature to feed into the matching module. Extensive experiments are conducted on Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets, and prove that our model achieves state-of-the-art results due to the effectiveness of incorporating the external SCG."
43,Exploiting Persona Information for Diverse Generation of Conversational Responses,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/721,"In human conversations, due to their personalities in mind, people can easily carry out and maintain the conversations. Giving conversational context with persona information to a chatbot, how to exploit the information to generate diverse and sustainable conversations is still a non-trivial task. Previous work on persona-based conversational models successfully make use of predefined persona information and have shown great promise in delivering more realistic responses. And they all learn with the assumption that given a source input, there is only one target response. However, in human conversations, there are massive appropriate responses to a given input message. In this paper, we propose a memory-augmented architecture to exploit persona information from context and incorporate a conditional variational autoencoder model together to generate diverse and sustainable conversations. We evaluate the proposed model on a benchmark persona-chat dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations show that our model can deliver more diverse and more engaging persona-based responses than baseline approaches."
44,Cold-Start Aware Deep Memory Network for Multi-Entity Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/722,"Various types of target information have been considered in aspect-based sentiment analysis, such as entities and aspects. Existing research has realized the importance of targets and developed methods with the goal of precisely modeling their contexts via generating target-specific representations. However, all these methods ignore that these representations cannot be learned well due to the lack of sufficient human-annotated target-related reviews, which leads to the data sparsity challenge, a.k.a. cold-start problem here. In this paper, we focus on a more general multiple entity aspect-based sentiment analysis (ME-ABSA) task which aims at identifying the sentiment polarity of different aspects of multiple entities in their context. Faced with severe cold-start scenario, we develop a novel and extensible deep memory network framework with cold-start aware computational layers which use frequency-guided attention mechanism to accentuate on the most related targets, and then compose their representations into a complementary vector for enhancing the representations of cold-start entities and aspects. To verify the effectiveness of the framework, we instantiate it with a concrete context encoding method and then apply the model to the ME-ABSA task. Experimental results conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ME-ABSA task."

We propose spamGAN, a generative adversarial network which relies on limited labeled data as well as unlabeled data for opinion spam detection. spamGAN improves the state-of-the-art GAN based techniques for text classification. Experiments on TripAdvisor data show that spamGAN outperforms existing techniques when labeled data is limited. spamGAN can also generate reviews with reasonable perplexity."
46,PRoFET: Predicting the Risk of Firms from Event Transcripts,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/724,"Financial risk, defined as the chance to deviate from return expectations, is most commonly measured with volatility. Due to its value for investment decision making, volatility prediction is probably among the most important tasks in finance and risk management. Although evidence exists that enriching purely financial models with natural language information can improve predictions of volatility, this task is still comparably underexplored. We introduce PRoFET, the first neural model for volatility prediction jointly exploiting both semantic language representations and a comprehensive set of financial features. As language data, we use transcripts from quarterly recurring events, so-called ""earnings calls""; in these calls, the performance of publicly traded companies is summarized and prognosticated by their management. We show that our proposed architecture, which models verbal context with an attention mechanism, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art and other strong baselines. Finally, we visualize this attention mechanism on the token-level, thus aiding interpretability and providing a use case of PRoFET as a tool for investment decision support."
47,Unsupervised Embedding Enhancements of Knowledge Graphs using Textual Associations,Main,"['Knowledge Extraction', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/725,"Knowledge graph embeddings are instrumental for representing and learning from multi-relational data, with recent embedding models showing high effectiveness for inferring new facts from existing databases. However, such precisely structured data is usually limited in quantity and in scope. Therefore, to fully optimize the embeddings it is important to also consider more widely available sources of information such as text. This paper describes an unsupervised approach to incorporate textual information by augmenting entity embeddings with embeddings of associated words. The approach does not modify the optimization objective for the knowledge graph embedding, which allows it to be integrated with existing embedding models. Two distinct forms of textual data are considered, with different embedding enhancements proposed for each case. In the first case, each entity has an associated text document that describes it. In the second case, a text document is not available, and instead entities occur as words or phrases in an unstructured corpus of text fragments. Experiments show that both methods can offer improvement on the link prediction task when applied to many different knowledge graph embedding models."
48,Swell-and-Shrink: Decomposing Image Captioning by Transformation and Summarization,Main,['Natural Language Summarization'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/726,"Image captioning is currently viewed as a problem analogous to machine translation. However, it always suffers from poor interpretability, coarse or even incorrect descriptions on regional details. Moreover, information abstraction and compression, as essential characteristics of captioning, are always overlooked and seldom discussed. To overcome the shortcomings, a swell-shrink method is proposed to redefine image captioning as a compositional task which consists of two separated modules: modality transformation and text compression. The former is guaranteed to accurately transform adequate visual content into textual form while the latter consists of a hierarchical LSTM which particularly emphasizes on removing the redundancy among multiple phrases and organizing the final abstractive caption. Additionally, the order and quality of region of interest and modality processing are studied to give insights of better understanding the influence of regional visual cues on language forming. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Our model uses shared attention layers for encoder and decoder, which make the most of the contextual clues, and a latent variable for learning the distribution of coherent story plots. Through drawing samples from the learned distribution, diverse reasonable plots can be generated. Both automatic and manual evaluations show that our model generates better story plots than state-of-the-art models in terms of readability, diversity and coherence."
50,Robust Embedding with Multi-Level Structures for Link Prediction,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/728,"Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has become crucial for the task of link prediction. Recent work applies encoder-decoder models to tackle this problem, where an encoder is formulated as a graph neural network (GNN) and a decoder is represented by an embedding method. These approaches enforce embedding techniques with structure information. Unfortunately, existing GNN-based frameworks still confront 3 severe problems: low representational power, stacking in a flat way, and poor robustness to noise. In this work, we propose a novel multi-level graph neural network (M-GNN) to address the above challenges. We first identify an injective aggregate scheme and design a powerful GNN layer using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Then, we define graph coarsening schemes for various kinds of relations, and stack GNN layers on a series of coarsened graphs, so as to model hierarchical structures. Furthermore, attention mechanisms are adopted so that our approach can make predictions accurately even on the noisy knowledge graph. Results on WN18 and FB15k datasets show that our approach is effective in the standard link prediction task, significantly and consistently outperforming competitive baselines. Furthermore, robustness analysis on FB15k-237 dataset demonstrates that our proposed M-GNN is highly robust to sparsity and noise."
51,Revealing Semantic Structures of Texts: Multi-grained Framework for Automatic Mind-map Generation,Main,"['Information Retrieval', 'Natural Language Summarization', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/729,"A mind-map is a diagram used to represent ideas linked to and arranged around a central concept. It’s easier to visually access the knowledge and ideas by converting a text to a mind-map. However, highlighting the semantic skeleton of an article remains a challenge. The key issue is to detect the relations amongst concepts beyond intra-sentence. In this paper, we propose a multi-grained framework for automatic mind-map generation. That is, a novel neural network is taken to detect the relations at first, which employs multi-hop self-attention and gated recurrence network to reveal the directed semantic relations via sentences. A recursive algorithm is then designed to select the most salient sentences to constitute the hierarchy. The human-like mind-map is automatically constructed with the key phrases in the salient sentences. Promising results have been achieved on the comparison with manual mind-maps. The case studies demonstrate that the generated mind-maps reveal the underlying semantic structures of the articles."

Previous work takes human interactions into the neural machine translation process to obtain improved results in target languages. However, not all model--translation errors are equal -- some are critical while others are minor. In the meanwhile, same translation mistakes occur repeatedly in similar context. To solve both issues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for translating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with critical revision instructions, therefore allows human to correct arbitrary words in model-translated sentences. In addition, CAMIT learns from and softly memorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of repeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation settings demonstrate that our proposed CAMIT enhances machine translation results significantly while requires fewer revision instructions from human compared to previous methods."
53,Modeling Noisy Hierarchical Types in Fine-Grained Entity Typing: A Content-Based Weighting Approach,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/731,"Fine-grained entity typing (FET), which annotates the entities in a sentence with a set of finely specified type labels, often serves as the first and critical step towards many natural language processing tasks. Despite great processes have been made, current FET methods have difficulty to cope with the noisy labels which naturally come with the data acquisition processes. Existing FET approaches either pre-process to clean the noise or simply focus on one of the noisy labels, sidestepping the fact that those noises are related and content dependent. In this paper, we directly model the structured, noisy labels with a novel content-sensitive weighting schema. Coupled with a newly devised cost function and a hierarchical type embedding strategy, our method leverages a random walk process to effectively weight out noisy labels during training. Experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and establish it as a new state of the art strategy for noisy entity typing problem."
54,Mask and Infill: Applying Masked Language Model for Sentiment Transfer,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/732,"This paper focuses on the task of sentiment transfer on non-parallel text, which modifies sentiment attributes (e.g., positive or negative) of sentences while preserving their attribute-independent contents. Existing methods adopt RNN encoder-decoder structure to generate a new sentence of a target sentiment word by word, which is trained on a particular dataset from scratch and have limited ability to produce satisfactory sentences. When people convert the sentiment attribute of a given sentence, a simple but effective approach is to only replace the sentiment tokens of the sentence with other expressions indicative of the target sentiment, instead of building a new sentence from scratch. Such a process is very similar to the task of Text Infilling or Cloze. With this intuition, we propose a two steps approach: Mask and Infill. In the \emph{mask} step, we identify and mask the sentiment tokens of a given sentence. In the \emph{infill} step, we utilize a pre-trained Masked Language Model (MLM) to infill the masked positions by predicting words or phrases conditioned on the context\footnote{In this paper, \emph{content} and \emph{context} are equivalent, \emph{style}, \emph{attribute} and \emph{label} are equivalent.}and target sentiment.

Such approaches work by learning KG representations so that entity alignment can be performed by measuring the similarities between entity embeddings. While promising, prior works in the field often fail to properly capture complex relation information that commonly exists in multi-relational KGs, leaving much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Dual-Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN) to incorporate relation information via attentive interactions between the knowledge graph and its dual relation counterpart, and further capture neighboring structures to learn better entity representations. Experiments on three real-world cross-lingual datasets show that our approach delivers better and more robust results over the state-of-the-art alignment methods by learning better KG representations."
56,RTHN: A RNN-Transformer Hierarchical Network for Emotion Cause Extraction,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/734,"The emotion cause extraction (ECE) task aims at discovering the potential causes behind a certain emotion expression in a document. Techniques including rule-based methods, traditional machine learning methods and deep neural networks have been proposed to solve this task. However, most of the previous work considered ECE as a set of independent clause classification problems and ignored the relations between multiple clauses in a document. In this work, we propose a joint emotion cause extraction framework, named RNN-Transformer Hierarchical Network (RTHN), to encode and classify multiple clauses synchronously. RTHN is composed of a lower word-level encoder based on RNNs to encode multiple words in each clause, and an upper clause-level encoder based on Transformer to learn the correlation between multiple clauses in a document. We furthermore propose ways to encode the relative position and global predication information into Transformer that can capture the causality between clauses and make RTHN more efficient. We finally achieve the best performance among 12 compared systems and improve the F1 score of the state-of-the-art from 72.69% to 76.77%."

But the inference of this model is slow due to the heavy use of dot-product attention in auto-regressive decoding. In this paper we speed up Transformer via a fast and lightweight attention model. More specifically, we share attention weights in adjacent layers and enable the efficient re-use of hidden states in a vertical manner. Moreover, the sharing policy can be jointly learned with the MT model. We test our approach on ten WMT and NIST OpenMT tasks. Experimental results show that it yields an average of 1.3X speed-up (with almost no decrease in BLEU) on top of a state-of-the-art implementation that has already adopted a cache for fast inference. Also, our approach obtains a 1.8X speed-up when it works with the AAN model. This is even 16 times faster than the baseline with no use of the attention cache."
58,A Goal-Driven Tree-Structured Neural Model for Math Word Problems,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/736,"Most existing neural models for math word problems exploit Seq2Seq model to generate solution expressions sequentially from left to right, whose results are far from satisfactory due to the lack of goal-driven mechanism commonly seen in human problem solving. This paper proposes a tree-structured neural model to generate expression tree in a goal-driven manner. Given a math word problem, the model first identifies and encodes its goal to achieve, and then the goal gets decomposed into sub-goals combined by an operator in a top-down recursive way. The whole process is repeated until the goal is simple enough to be realized by a known quantity as leaf node. During the process, two-layer gated-feedforward networks are designed to implement each step of goal decomposition, and a recursive neural network is used to encode fulfilled subtrees into subtree embeddings, which provides a better representation of subtrees than the simple goals of subtrees. Experimental results on the dataset Math23K have shown that our tree-structured model outperforms significantly several state-of-the-art models."

Most previous methods either encode each of the two sentences into a vector representation (sentence-level embedding) or leverage word-level interaction features between the two sentences. In this study, we propose to take the sentence-level embedding features and the word-level interaction features as two distinct views of a sentence pair, and unify them with a framework of Variational Autoencoders such that the sentence pair is matched in a semi-supervised manner. The proposed model is referred to as Dual-View Variational AutoEncoder (DV-VAE), where the optimization of the variational lower bound can be interpreted as an implicit Co-Training mechanism for two matching models over distinct views. Experiments on SNLI, Quora and a Community Question Answering dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DV-VAE over several strong semi-supervised and supervised text matching models."
60,Earlier Attention? Aspect-Aware LSTM for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/738,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict fine-grained sentiments of comments with respect to given aspect terms or categories. In previous ABSA methods, the importance of aspect has been realized and verified. Most existing LSTM-based models take aspect into account via the attention mechanism, where the attention weights are calculated after the context is modeled in the form of contextual vectors. However, aspect-related information may be already discarded and aspect-irrelevant information may be retained in classic LSTM cells in the context modeling process, which can be improved to generate more effective context representations. This paper proposes a novel variant of LSTM, termed as aspect-aware LSTM (AA-LSTM), which incorporates aspect information into LSTM cells in the context modeling stage before the attention mechanism. Therefore, our AA-LSTM can dynamically produce aspect-aware contextual representations. We experiment with several representative LSTM-based models by replacing the classic LSTM cells with the AA-LSTM cells.

However, collecting large-scale parallel data for training is costly and laborious.  Recently, unsupervised neural machine translation has attracted more and more attention, due to its demand for monolingual corpus only, which is common and easy to obtain, and its great potentials for the low-resource or even zero-resource machine translation. In this work, we propose a general framework called Polygon-Net, which leverages multi auxiliary languages for jointly boosting unsupervised neural machine translation models. Specifically, we design a novel loss function for multi-language unsupervised neural machine translation. In addition, different from the literature that just updating one or two models individually, Polygon-Net enables multiple unsupervised models in the framework to update in turn and enhance each other for the first time. In this way, multiple unsupervised translation models are associated with each other for training to achieve better performance. Experiments on the benchmark datasets including UN Corpus and WMT show that our approach significantly improves over the two-language based methods, and achieves better performance with more languages introduced to the framework."
62,Neural Collective Entity Linking Based on Recurrent Random Walk Network Learning,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/740,"Beneﬁting from the excellent ability of neural networks on learning semantic representations, existing studies for entity linking (EL) have resorted to neural networks to exploit both the local mention-to-entity compatibility and the global interdependence between different EL decisions for target entity disambiguation. However, most neural collective EL methods depend entirely upon neural networks to automatically model the semantic dependencies between different EL decisions, which lack of the guidance from external knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network with recurrent random-walk layers for collective EL, which introduces external knowledge to model the semantic interdependence between different EL decisions. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst establish a model based on local context features, and then stack random-walk layers to reinforce the evidence for related EL decisions into high-probability decisions, where the semantic interdependence between candidate entities is mainly induced from an external knowledge base. Finally, a semantic regularizer that preserves the collective EL decisions consistency is incorporated into the conventional objective function, so that the external knowledge base can be fully exploited in collective EL decisions. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on various datasets show that our model achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art models. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/RRWEL."
63,Robust Audio Adversarial Example for a Physical Attack,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/741,"We propose a method to generate audio adversarial examples that can attack a state-of-the-art speech recognition model in the physical world. Previous work assumes that generated adversarial examples are directly fed to the recognition model, and is not able to perform such a physical attack because of reverberation and noise from playback environments. In contrast, our method obtains robust adversarial examples by simulating transformations caused by playback or recording in the physical world and incorporating the transformations into the generation process. Evaluation and a listening experiment demonstrated that our adversarial examples are able to attack without being noticed by humans. This result suggests that audio adversarial examples generated by the proposed method may become a real threat."
64,HorNet: A Hierarchical Offshoot Recurrent Network for Improving Person Re-ID via Image Captioning,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/742,"Person re-identification (re-ID)  aims to recognize a person-of-interest across different cameras with notable appearance variance. Existing research works focused on the capability and robustness of visual representation. In this paper, instead, we propose a novel hierarchical offshoot recurrent network (HorNet) for improving person re-ID via image captioning. Image captions are semantically richer and more consistent than visual attributes, which could significantly alleviate the variance. We use the similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) and an image captioner to fulfill domain transfer and language descriptions generation. Then the proposed HorNet can learn the visual and language representation from both the images and captions jointly, and thus enhance the performance of person re-ID. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets with or without image captions, i.e., CUHK03, Market-1501, and Duke-MTMC, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method. Our method can generate and extract meaningful image captions while achieving state-of-the-art performance."
65,Knowledge-enhanced Hierarchical Attention for Community Question Answering with Multi-task and Adaptive Learning,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/743,"In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-enhanced Hierarchical Attention for community question answering with Multi-task learning and Adaptive learning (KHAMA). First, we propose a hierarchical attention network to fully fuse knowledge from input documents and knowledge base (KB) by exploiting the semantic compositionality of the input sequences. The external factual knowledge helps recognize background knowledge (entity mentions and their relationships) and eliminate noise information from long documents that have sophisticated syntactic and semantic structures. In addition, we build multiple CQA models with adaptive boosting and then combine these models to learn a more effective and robust CQA system. Further- more, KHAMA is a multi-task learning model. It regards CQA as the primary task and question categorization as the auxiliary task, aiming at learning a category-aware document encoder and enhance the quality of identifying essential information from long questions. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that KHAMA achieves substantial improvements over the compared methods."
66,Knowledgeable Storyteller: A Commonsense-Driven Generative Model for Visual Storytelling,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/744,"The visual storytelling (VST) task aims at generating a reasonable and coherent paragraph-level story with the image stream as input. Different from caption that is a direct and literal description of image content, the story in the VST task tends to contain plenty of imaginary concepts that do not appear in the image. This requires the AI agent to reason and associate with the imaginary concepts based on implicit commonsense knowledge to generate a reasonable story describing the image stream. Therefore, in this work, we present a commonsense-driven generative model, which aims to introduce crucial commonsense from the external knowledge base for visual storytelling. Our approach first extracts a set of candidate knowledge graphs from the knowledge base. Then, an elaborately designed vision-aware directional encoding schema is adopted to effectively integrate the most informative commonsense. Besides, we strive to maximize the semantic similarity within the output during decoding to enhance the coherence of the generated text. Results show that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, which achieves a 29\% relative improvement of CIDEr score. With additional commonsense and semantic-relevance based objective, the generated stories are more diverse and coherent."
67,Triplet Enhanced AutoEncoder: Model-free Discriminative Network Embedding,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/745,"Deep autoencoder is widely used in dimensionality reduction because of the expressive power of the neural network. Therefore, it is naturally suitable for embedding tasks, which essentially compresses high-dimensional information into a low-dimensional latent space. In terms of network representation, methods based on autoencoder such as SDNE and DNGR have achieved comparable results with the state-of-arts. However, all of them do not leverage label information, which leads to the embeddings lack the characteristic of discrimination. In this paper, we present Triplet Enhanced AutoEncoder (TEA), a new deep network embedding approach from the perspective of metric learning. Equipped with the triplet-loss constraint, the proposed approach not only allows capturing the topological structure but also preserving the discriminative information. Moreover, unlike existing discriminative embedding techniques, TEA is independent of any specific classifier, we call it the model-free property. Extensive empirical results on three public datasets (i.e, Cora, Citeseer and BlogCatalog) show that TEA is stable and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with both supervised and unsupervised network embedding approaches on various percentages of labeled data. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/yybeta/TEA."
68,Improving Multilingual Sentence Embedding using Bi-directional Dual Encoder with Additive Margin Softmax,Main,"['Information Retrieval', 'Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Embeddings']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/746,"In this paper, we present an approach to learn multilingual sentence embeddings using a bi-directional dual-encoder with additive margin softmax. The embeddings are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the United Nations (UN) parallel corpus retrieval task. In all the languages tested, the system achieves P@1 of 86% or higher. We use pairs retrieved by our approach to train NMT models that achieve similar performance to models trained on gold pairs. We explore simple document-level embeddings constructed by averaging our sentence embeddings. On the UN document-level retrieval task, document embeddings achieve around 97% on P@1 for all experimented language pairs. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed model on the BUCC mining task. The learned embeddings with raw cosine similarity scores achieve competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art models, and with a second-stage scorer we achieve a new state-of-the-art level on this task."
69,Utilizing Non-Parallel Text for Style Transfer by Making Partial Comparisons,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/747,"Text style transfer aims to rephrase a given sentence into a different style without changing its original content. Since parallel corpora (i.e. sentence pairs with the same content but different styles) are usually unavailable, most previous works solely guide the transfer process with distributional information, i.e. using style-related classifiers or language models, which neglect the correspondence of instances, leading to poor transfer performance, especially for the content preservation. In this paper, we propose making partial comparisons to explicitly model the content and style correspondence of instances, respectively. To train the partial comparators, we propose methods to extract partial-parallel training instances automatically from the non-parallel data, and to further enhance the training process by using data augmentation. We perform experiments that compare our method to other existing approaches on two review datasets. Both automatic and manual evaluations show that our approach can significantly improve the performance of existing adversarial methods, and outperforms most state-of-the-art models. Our code and data will be available on Github."

It involves capturing global dependencies among sentences regardless of their input order. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible graph-based neural sentence ordering model, which adopts graph recurrent network \citep{Zhang:acl18} to accurately learn semantic representations of the sentences. Instead of assuming connections between all pairs of input sentences, we use entities that are shared among multiple sentences to make more expressive graph representations with less noise. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art systems on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. We also conduct a thorough analysis on how entities help the performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/NSEG.git."
71,Refining Word Representations by Manifold Learning,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/749,"Pre-trained distributed word representations have been proven useful in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the effect of words’ geometric structure on word representations has not been carefully studied yet. The existing word representations methods underestimate the words whose distances are close in the Euclidean space, while overestimating words with a much greater distance. In this paper, we propose a word vector refinement model to correct the pre-trained word embedding, which brings the similarity of words in Euclidean space closer to word semantics by using manifold learning. This approach is theoretically founded in the metric recovery paradigm. Our word representations have been evaluated on a variety of lexical-level intrinsic tasks (semantic relatedness, semantic similarity) and the experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms several popular word representations approaches."
72,Beyond Word Attention: Using Segment Attention in Neural Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/750,"Relation extraction studies the issue of predicting semantic relations between pairs of entities in sentences. Attention mechanisms are often used in this task to alleviate the inner-sentence noise by performing soft selections of words independently. Based on the observation that information pertinent to relations is usually contained within segments (continuous words in a sentence), it is possible to make use of this phenomenon for better extraction. In this paper, we aim to incorporate such segment information into neural relation extractor. Our approach views the attention mechanism as linear-chain conditional random fields over a set of latent variables whose edges encode the desired structure, and regards attention weight as the marginal distribution of each word being selected as a part of the relational expression. Experimental results show that our method can attend to continuous relational expressions without explicit annotations, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale TACRED dataset."
73,Adapting BERT for Target-Oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/751,"As an important task in Sentiment Analysis, Target-oriented Sentiment Classification (TSC) aims to identify sentiment polarities over each opinion target in a sentence. However, existing approaches to this task primarily rely on the textual content, but ignoring the other increasingly popular multimodal data sources (e.g., images), which can enhance the robustness of these text-based models. Motivated by this observation and inspired by the recently proposed BERT architecture, we study Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification (TMSC) and propose a multimodal BERT architecture. To model intra-modality dynamics, we first apply BERT to obtain target-sensitive textual representations. We then borrow the idea from self-attention and design a target attention mechanism to perform target-image matching to derive target-sensitive visual representations. To model inter-modality dynamics, we further propose to stack a set of self-attention layers to capture multimodal interactions. Experimental results show that our model can outperform several highly competitive approaches for TSC and TMSC."
74,Modeling both Context- and Speaker-Sensitive Dependence for Emotion Detection in Multi-speaker Conversations,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/752,"Recently, emotion detection in conversations becomes a hot research topic in the Natural Language Processing community. In this paper, we focus on emotion detection in multi-speaker conversations instead of traditional two-speaker conversations in existing studies. Different from non-conversation text, emotion detection in conversation text has one specific challenge in modeling the context-sensitive dependence. Besides, emotion detection in multi-speaker conversations endorses another specific challenge in modeling the speaker-sensitive dependence. To address above two challenges, we propose a conversational graph-based convolutional neural network. On the one hand, our approach represents each utterance and each speaker as a node. On the other hand, the context-sensitive dependence is represented by an undirected edge between two utterances nodes from the same conversation and the speaker-sensitive dependence is represented by an undirected edge between an utterance node and its speaker node. In this way, the entire conversational corpus can be symbolized as a large heterogeneous graph and the emotion detection task can be recast as a classification problem of the utterance nodes in the graph. The experimental results on a multi-modal and multi-speaker conversation corpus demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Traditional methods solve them as a pipeline, which does not make use of task correlation for their mutual benefits. There have been recent efforts towards building a joint model for all tasks. However, due to technical challenges, there has not been work predicting the joint output structure as a single task. We build a first model to this end using a neural transition-based framework, incrementally predicting complex joint structures in a state-transition process. Results on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the joint model, which gives the best result in the literature."
76,Multi-view Knowledge Graph Embedding for Entity Alignment,Main,"['Embeddings', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/754,"We study the problem of embedding-based entity alignment between knowledge graphs (KGs). Previous works mainly focus on the relational structure of entities. Some further incorporate another type of features, such as attributes, for refinement. However, a vast of entity features are still unexplored or not equally treated together, which impairs the accuracy and robustness of embedding-based entity alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies multiple views of entities to learn embeddings for entity alignment. Specifically, we embed entities based on the views of entity names, relations and attributes, with several combination strategies. Furthermore, we design some cross-KG inference methods to enhance the alignment between two KGs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding-based entity alignment methods. The selected views, cross-KG inference and combination strategies all contribute to the performance improvement."
77,Quantum-Inspired Interactive Networks for Conversational Sentiment Analysis,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification', 'Dialogue']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/755,"Conversational sentiment analysis is an emerging, yet challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) subtask. It aims to discover the affective state of each participant in a conversation. There exists a wealth of interaction information that affects the sentiment of speakers. However, the existing sentiment analysis approaches are insufficient in dealing with this task due to ignoring the interactions and dependency relationships between utterances. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by modeling intrautterance and inter-utterance interaction dynamics. We propose an approach called quantum-inspired interactive networks (QIN), which leverages the mathematical formalism of quantum theory (QT) and the long short term memory (LSTM) network, to learn such interaction dynamics. Specifically, a density matrix based convolutional neural network (DM-CNN) is proposed to capture the interactions within each utterance (i.e., the correlations between words), and a strong-weak influence model inspired by quantum measurement theory is developed to learn the interactions between adjacent utterances (i.e., how one speaker influences another). Extensive experiments are conducted on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the QIN model."

The challenges of building such a model lie in how to ground conversation contexts with background documents and how to recognize important information in the documents for matching. To overcome the challenges, DGMN fuses information in a document and a context into representations of each other, and dynamically determines if grounding is necessary and importance of different parts of the document and the context through hierarchical interaction with a response at the matching step. Empirical studies on two public data sets indicate that DGMN can significantly improve upon state-of-the-art methods and at the same time enjoys good interpretability."
79,Recurrent Neural Network for Text Classification with Hierarchical Multiscale Dense Connections,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/757,"Text classification is a fundamental task in many Natural Language Processing applications. While recurrent neural networks have achieved great success in performing text classification, they fail to capture the hierarchical structure and long-term semantics dependency which are common features of text data. Inspired by the advent of the dense connection pattern in advanced convolutional neural networks, we propose a simple yet effective recurrent architecture, named Hierarchical Mutiscale Densely Connected RNNs (HM-DenseRNNs), which: 1) enables direct access to the hidden states of all preceding recurrent units via dense connections, and 2) organizes multiple densely connected recurrent units into a hierarchical multi-scale structure, where the layers are updated at different scales. HM-DenseRNNs can effectively capture long-term dependencies among words in long text data, and a dense recurrent block is further introduced to reduce the number of parameters and enhance training efficiency. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture on three text datasets and the results verify the advantages of HM-DenseRNN over the baseline methods in terms of the classification accuracy."
80,RLTM: An Efficient Neural IR Framework for Long Documents,Main,['Information Retrieval'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/758,"Deep neural networks have achieved significant improvements in information retrieval (IR). However, most existing models are computational costly and can not efficiently scale to long documents. This paper proposes a novel End-to-End neural ranking framework called Reinforced Long Text Matching (RLTM) which matches a query with long documents efficiently and effectively. The core idea behind the framework can be analogous to the human judgment process which firstly locates the relevance parts quickly from the whole document and then matches these parts with the query carefully to obtain the final label. Firstly, we select relevant sentences from the long documents by a coarse and efficient matching model. Secondly, we generate a relevance score by a more sophisticated matching model based on the sentence selected. The whole model is trained jointly with reinforcement learning in a pairwise manner by maximizing the expected score gaps between positive and negative examples. Experimental results demonstrate that RLTM has greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the states-of-the-art models."

Despite deep neural networks have shown strong performance in the text classification task, they are unable to learn adaptive structure features automatically and lack of a method for fully utilizing the extracted features. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that dynamically routes hierarchical structure feature to attentive capsule, named HAC. Specifically, we first adopt intermediate information of a well-designed deep dilated CNN to form hierarchical structure features. Different levels of structure representations are corresponding to various linguistic units such as word, phrase and clause, respectively. Furthermore, we design a capsule module using dynamic routing and equip it with an attention mechanism. The attentive capsule implements an effective aggregation strategy for feature clustering and selection. Extensive results on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model obtains competitive performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.

82,Sequence Generation: From Both Sides to the Middle,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Summarization']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/760,"The encoder-decoder framework has achieved promising process for many sequence generation tasks, such as neural machine translation and text summarization. Such a framework usually generates a sequence token by token from left to right, hence (1) this autoregressive decoding procedure is time-consuming when the output sentence becomes longer, and (2) it lacks the guidance of future context which is crucial to avoid under-translation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a synchronous bidirectional sequence generation (SBSG) model which predicts its outputs from both sides to the middle simultaneously. In the SBSG model, we enable the left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) generation to help and interact with each other by leveraging interactive bidirectional attention network. Experiments on neural machine translation (En-De, Ch-En, and En-Ro) and text summarization tasks show that the proposed model significantly speeds up decoding while improving the generation quality compared to the autoregressive Transformer."

Furthermore, aligning with an isotropic noise can deliver satisfactory results. We provide a theoretical framework and guarantees which aid in the understanding of empirical results."
84,A Span-based Joint Model for Opinion Target Extraction and Target Sentiment Classification,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/762,"Target-Based Sentiment Analysis aims at extracting opinion targets and classifying the sentiment polarities expressed on each target. Recently, token based sequence tagging methods have been successfully applied to jointly solve the two tasks, which aims to predict a tag for each token. Since they do not treat a target containing several words as a whole, it might be difficult to make use of the global information to identify that opinion target, leading to incorrect extraction. Independently predicting the sentiment for each token may also lead to sentiment inconsistency for different words in an opinion target. In this paper, inspired by span-based methods in NLP, we propose a simple and effective joint model to conduct extraction and classification at span level rather than token level. Our model first emulates spans with one or more tokens and learns their representation based on the tokens inside. And then, a span-aware attention mechanism is designed to compute the sentiment information towards each span. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
