0,Hierarchical Linear Disentanglement of Data-Driven Conceptual Spaces,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/494,"Conceptual spaces are geometric meaning representations in which similar entities are represented by similar vectors. They are widely used in cognitive science, but there has been relatively little work on learning such representations from data. In particular, while standard representation learning methods can be used to induce vector space embeddings from text corpora, these differ from conceptual spaces in two crucial ways.  First, the dimensions of a conceptual space correspond to salient semantic features, known as quality dimensions, whereas the dimensions of learned vector space embeddings typically lack any clear interpretation. This has been partially addressed in previous work, which has shown that it is possible to identify directions in learned vector spaces which capture semantic features. Second, conceptual spaces are normally organised into a set of domains, each of which is associated with a separate vector space. In contrast, learned embeddings represent all entities in a single vector space. Our hypothesis in this paper is that such single-space representations are sub-optimal for learning quality dimensions, due to the fact that semantic features are often only relevant to a subset of the entities. We show that this issue can be mitigated by identifying features in a hierarchical fashion. Intuitively, the top-level features split the vector space into different domains, making it possible to subsequently identify domain-specific quality dimensions."
1,How Far are We from Effective Context Modeling? An Exploratory Study on Semantic Parsing in Context,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Coreference Resolution', 'Dialogue', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/495,"Recently semantic parsing in context has received a considerable attention, which is challenging since there are complex contextual phenomena. Previous works verified their proposed methods in limited scenarios, which motivates us to conduct an exploratory study on context modeling methods under real-world semantic parsing in context. We present a grammar-based decoding semantic parser and adapt typical context modeling methods on top of it. We evaluate 13 context modeling methods on two large complex cross-domain datasets, and our best model achieves state-of-the-art performances on both datasets with significant improvements. Furthermore, we summarize the most frequent contextual phenomena, with a fine-grained analysis on representative models, which may shed light on potential research directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/ContextualSP."
2,Lexical-Constraint-Aware Neural Machine Translation via Data Augmentation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/496,"Leveraging lexical constraint is extremely significant in domain-specific machine translation and interactive machine translation. Previous studies mainly focus on extending beam search algorithm or augmenting the training corpus by replacing source phrases with the corresponding target translation. These methods either suffer from the heavy computation cost during inference or depend on the quality of the bilingual dictionary pre-specified by user or constructed with statistical machine translation. In response to these problems, we present a conceptually simple and empirically effective data augmentation approach in lexical constrained neural machine translation. Specifically, we make constraint-aware training data by first randomly sampling the phrases of the reference as constraints, and then packing them together into the source sentence with a separation symbol. Extensive experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that our approach achieves superior translation results over the existing systems, improving translation of constrained sentences without hurting the unconstrained ones."
3,Attention-based Multi-level Feature Fusion for Named Entity Recognition,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Tagging, chunking, and parsing', 'Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/497,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in the natural language processing (NLP) area. Recently, representation learning methods (e.g., character embedding and word embedding) have achieved promising recognition results. However, existing models only consider partial features derived from words or characters while failing to integrate semantic and syntactic information (e.g., capitalization, inter-word relations, keywords, lexical phrases, etc.) from multi-level perspectives. Intuitively, multi-level features can be helpful when recognizing named entities from complex sentences. In this study, we propose a novel framework called attention-based multi-level feature fusion (AMFF), which is used to capture the multi-level features from different perspectives to improve NER. Our model consists of four components to respectively capture the local character-level, global character-level, local word-level, and global word-level features, which are then fed into a BiLSTM-CRF network for the final sequence labeling. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines."
4,Exemplar Guided Neural Dialogue Generation,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/498,"Humans benefit from previous experiences when taking actions. Similarly, related examples from the training data also provide exemplary information for neural dialogue models when responding to a given input message. However, effectively fusing such exemplary information into dialogue generation is non-trivial: useful exemplars are required to be not only literally-similar, but also topic-related with the given context. Noisy exemplars impair the neural dialogue models understanding the conversation topics and even corrupt the response generation. To address the issues, we propose an exemplar guided neural dialogue generation model where exemplar responses are retrieved in terms of both the text similarity and the topic proximity through a two-stage exemplar retrieval model. In the first stage, a small subset of conversations is retrieved from a training set given a dialogue context.  These candidate exemplars are then finely ranked regarding the topical proximity to choose the best-matched exemplar response.  To further induce the neural dialogue generation model consulting the exemplar response and the conversation topics more faithfully, we introduce a multi-source sampling mechanism to provide the dialogue model with both local exemplary semantics and global topical guidance during decoding. Empirical evaluations on a large-scale conversation dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of both the quantitative metrics and human evaluations."
5,Knowledge Enhanced Event Causality Identification with Mention Masking Generalizations,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Discourse']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/499,"Identifying causal relations of events is a crucial language understanding task. Despite many efforts for this task, existing methods lack the ability to adopt background knowledge, and they typically generalize poorly to new, previously unseen data. In this paper, we present a new method for event causality identification, aiming to address limitations of previous methods. On the one hand, our model can leverage external knowledge for reasoning, which can greatly enrich the representation of events; On the other hand, our model can mine event-agnostic, context-specific patterns, via a mechanism called event mention masking generalization, which can greatly enhance the ability of our model to handle new, previously unseen cases. In experiments, we evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets and show our model outperforms previous methods by a significant margin. Moreover, we perform 1) cross-topic adaptation, 2) exploiting unseen predicates, and 3) cross-task adaptation to evaluate the generalization ability of our model. Experimental results show that our model demonstrates a definite advantage over previous methods."
6,Two-Phase Hypergraph Based Reasoning with Dynamic Relations for Multi-Hop KBQA,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/500,"Multi-hop knowledge base question answering (KBQA) aims at finding the answers to a factoid question by reasoning across multiple triples. Note that when human performs multi-hop reasoning, one tends to concentrate on specific relation at different hops and pinpoint a group of entities connected by the relation. Hypergraph convolutional networks (HGCN) can simulate this behavior by leveraging hyperedges to connect more than two nodes more than pairwise connection. However, HGCN is for undirected graphs and does not consider the direction of information transmission. We introduce the directed-HGCN (DHGCN) to adapt to the knowledge graph with directionality.  Inspired by human's hop-by-hop reasoning, we propose an interpretable KBQA model based on DHGCN, namely two-phase hypergraph based reasoning with dynamic relations, which explicitly updates relation information and dynamically pays attention to different relations at different hops. Moreover, the model predicts relations hop-by-hop to generate an intermediate relation path. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely used multi-hop KBQA datasets to prove the effectiveness of our model."
7,LogiQA: A Challenge Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning,Main,"['Resources and Evaluation', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/501,"Machine reading is a fundamental task for testing the capability of natural language understand- ing, which is closely related to human cognition in many aspects. With the rising of deep learning techniques, algorithmic models rival human performances on simple QA, and thus increasingly challenging machine reading datasets have been proposed. Though various challenges such as evidence integration and commonsense knowledge have been integrated, one of the fundamental capabilities in human reading, namely logical reasoning, is not fully investigated. We build a comprehensive dataset, named LogiQA, which is sourced from expert-written questions for testing human Logical reasoning. It consists of 8,678 QA instances, covering multiple types of deductive reasoning. Results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far worse than human ceiling. Our dataset can also serve as a benchmark for reinvestigating logical AI under the deep learning NLP setting. The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/lgw863/LogiQA-dataset."
8,Guided Generation of Cause and Effect,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/502,"We present a conditional text generation framework that posits sentential expressions of possible causes and effects. This framework depends on two novel resources we develop in the course of this work: a very large-scale collection of English sentences expressing causal patterns (CausalBank); and a refinement over previous work on constructing large lexical causal knowledge graphs (Cause Effect Graph). Further, we extend prior work in lexically-constrained decoding to support disjunctive positive constraints. Human assessment conﬁrms that our approach gives high-quality and diverse outputs. Finally, we use CausalBank to perform continued training of an encoder supporting a recent state-of-the-art model for causal reasoning, leading to a 3-point improvement on the COPA challenge set, with no change in model architecture."
9,EmoElicitor: An Open Domain Response Generation Model with User Emotional Reaction Awareness,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/503,"Generating emotional responses is crucial for building human-like dialogue systems. However, existing studies  have focused only on generating responses by controlling the agents' emotions, while the feelings of the users, which are the ultimate concern of a dialogue system, have been neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel variational model named EmoElicitor to generate appropriate responses that can elicit user's specific emotion. We incorporate the next-round utterance after the response into the posterior network to enrich the context, and we decompose single latent variable into several sequential ones to guide response generation with the help of a pre-trained language model. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world dataset show that EmoElicitor not only performs better than the baselines in term of diversity and semantic similarity, but also can elicit emotion with higher accuracy."
10,RECPARSER: A Recursive Semantic Parsing Framework for Text-to-SQL Task,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/504,"Neural semantic parsers usually fail to parse long and complicated utterances into nested SQL queries, due to the large search space. In this paper, we propose a novel recursive semantic parsing framework called RECPARSER to generate the nested SQL query layer-by-layer. It decomposes the complicated nested SQL query generation problem into several progressive non-nested SQL query generation problems.  Furthermore, we propose a novel Question Decomposer module to explicitly encourage RECPARSER to focus on different components of an utterance when predicting SQL queries of different layers. Experiments on the Spider dataset show that our approach is more effective compared to the previous works at predicting the nested SQL queries. In addition, we achieve an overall accuracy that is comparable with state-of-the-art approaches."
11,Learning Latent Forests for Medical Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/505,"The goal of medical relation extraction is to detect relations among entities, such as genes, mutations and drugs in medical texts. Dependency tree structures have been proven useful for this task. Existing approaches to such relation extraction leverage off-the-shelf dependency parsers to obtain a syntactic tree or forest for the text. However, for the medical domain, low parsing accuracy may lead to error propagation downstream the relation extraction pipeline. In this work, we propose a novel model which treats the dependency structure as a latent variable and induces it from the unstructured text in an end-to-end fashion. Our model can be understood as composing task-specific dependency forests that capture non-local interactions for better relation extraction. Extensive results on four datasets show that our model is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art systems without relying on any direct tree supervision or pre-training."
12,Global Structure and Local Semantics-Preserved Embeddings for Entity Alignment,Main,"['Embeddings', 'Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/506,"Entity alignment (EA) aims to identify entities located in different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world object. To learn the entity representations, most EA approaches rely on either translation-based methods which capture the local relation semantics of entities or graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which exploit the global KG structure. Afterward, the aligned entities are identified based on their distances. In this paper, we propose to jointly leverage the global KG structure and entity-specific relational triples for better entity alignment. Specifically, a global structure and local semantics preserving network is proposed to learn entity representations in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms other entity alignment approaches and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance."
13,Hierarchical Matching Network for Heterogeneous Entity Resolution,Main,"['Coreference Resolution', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/507,"Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify data records referring to the same real-world entity. Most existing ER approaches rely on the assumption that the entity records to be resolved are homogeneous, i.e., their attributes are aligned. Unfortunately, entities in real-world datasets are often heterogeneous, usually coming from different sources and being represented using different attributes. Furthermore, the entities’ attribute values may be redundant, noisy, missing, misplaced, or misspelled—we refer to it as the dirty data problem. To resolve the above problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical matching network (HierMatcher) for entity resolution, which can jointly match entities in three levels—token, attribute, and entity. At the token level, a cross-attribute token alignment and comparison layer is designed to adaptively compare heterogeneous entities. At the attribute level, an attribute-aware attention mechanism is proposed to denoise dirty attribute values. Finally, the entity level matching layer effectively aggregates all matching evidence for the final ER decisions. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous ER methods on homogeneous, heterogeneous and dirty datasets."
14,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of a Pretrained Cross-Lingual Language Model,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/508,"Recent research indicates that pretraining cross-lingual language models on large-scale unlabeled texts yields significant performance improvements over various cross-lingual and low-resource tasks. Through training on one hundred languages and terabytes of texts, cross-lingual language models have proven to be effective in leveraging high-resource languages to enhance low-resource language processing and outperform monolingual models. In this paper, we further investigate the cross-lingual and cross-domain (CLCD) setting when a pretrained cross-lingual language model needs to adapt to new domains. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised feature decomposition method that can automatically extract domain-specific features and domain-invariant features from the entangled pretrained cross-lingual representations, given unlabeled raw texts in the source language. Our proposed model leverages mutual information estimation to decompose the representations computed by a cross-lingual model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art pretrained cross-lingual language model in the CLCD setting."
15,"Retrieve, Program, Repeat: Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Alternate Meta-learning",Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/509,"A compelling approach to complex question answering is to convert the question to a sequence of actions, which can then be executed on the knowledge base to yield the answer, aka the programmer-interpreter approach. Use similar training questions to the test question, meta-learning enables the programmer to adapt to unseen questions to tackle potential distributional biases quickly. However, this comes at the cost of manually labeling similar questions to learn a retrieval model, which is tedious and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel method that automatically learns a retrieval model alternately with the programmer from weak supervision, i.e., the system’s performance with respect to the produced answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train the retrieval model with the programmer jointly. Our system leads to state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale task for complex question answering over knowledge bases. We have released our code at https://github.com/DevinJake/MARL."
16,Generating Reasonable Legal Text through the Combination of Language Modeling and Question Answering,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Question Answering', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/510,"Due to the improvement of Language Modeling, the emerging NLP assistant tools aiming for text generation greatly reduce the human workload on writing documents. However, the generation of legal text faces greater challenges than ordinary texts because of its high requirement for keeping logic reasonable, which can not be guaranteed by  Language Modeling right now. To generate reasonable legal documents, we propose a novel method CoLMQA, which (1) combines Language Modeling and Question Answering, (2) generates text with slots by Language Modeling, and (3) fills the slots by our proposed Question Answering method named Transformer-based Key-Value Memory Networks. In CoLMQA, the slots represent the text part that needs to be highly constrained by logic, such as the name of the law and the number of the law article. And the Question Answering fills the slots in context with the help of Legal Knowledge Base to keep logic reasonable. The experiment verifies the quality of legal documents generated by CoLMQA, surpassing the documents generated by pure Language Modeling."
17,Modeling Voting for System Combination in Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/511,"System combination is an important technique for combining the hypotheses of different machine translation systems to improve translation performance. Although early statistical approaches to system combination have been proven effective in analyzing the consensus between hypotheses, they suffer from the error propagation problem due to the use of pipelines. While this problem has been alleviated by end-to-end training of multi-source sequence-to-sequence models recently, these neural models do not explicitly analyze the relations between hypotheses and fail to capture their agreement because the attention to a word in a hypothesis is calculated independently, ignoring the fact that the word might occur in multiple hypotheses. In this work, we propose an approach to modeling voting for system combination in machine translation. The basic idea is to enable words in hypotheses from different systems to vote on words that are representative and should get involved in the generation process. This can be done by quantifying the influence of each voter and its preference for each candidate. Our approach combines the advantages of statistical and neural methods since it can not only analyze the relations between hypotheses but also allow for end-to-end training. Experiments show that our approach is capable of better taking advantage of the consensus between hypotheses and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and English-German machine translation tasks."
18,Unsupervised Multilingual Alignment using Wasserstein Barycenter,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/512,"We study unsupervised multilingual alignment, the problem of finding word-to-word translations between multiple languages without using any parallel data. One popular strategy is to reduce multilingual alignment to the much simplified bilingual setting, by picking one of the input languages as the pivot language that we transit through. However, it is well-known that transiting through a poorly chosen pivot language (such as English) may severely degrade the translation quality, since the assumed transitive relations among all pairs of languages may not be enforced in the training process. Instead of going through a rather arbitrarily chosen pivot language, we propose to use the Wasserstein barycenter as a more informative ``mean'' language: it encapsulates information from all languages and minimizes all pairwise transportation costs. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performances."
19,A De Novo Divide-and-Merge Paradigm for Acoustic Model Optimization in Automatic Speech Recognition,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/513,"Due to the rising awareness of privacy protection and the voluminous scale of speech data, it is becoming infeasible for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developers to train the acoustic model with complete data as before. In this paper, we propose a novel Divide-and-Merge paradigm to solve salient problems plaguing the ASR field. In the Divide phase, multiple acoustic models are trained based upon different subsets of the complete speech data, while in the Merge phase two novel algorithms are utilized to generate a high-quality acoustic model based upon those trained on data subsets. We first propose the Genetic Merge Algorithm (GMA), which is a highly specialized algorithm for optimizing acoustic models but suffers from low efficiency. We further propose the SGD-Based Optimizational Merge Algorithm (SOMA), which effectively alleviates the efficiency bottleneck of GMA and maintains superior performance. Extensive experiments on public data show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art."
20,Neural Abstractive Summarization with Structural Attention,Main,"['Natural Language Summarization', 'Other']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/514,"Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder architectures have obtained impressive performance on abstractive summarization of news articles. However, these methods fail to account for long term dependencies within the sentences of a document. This problem is exacerbated in multi-document summarization tasks such as summarizing the popular opinion in threads present in community question answering (CQA) websites such as Yahoo! Answers and Quora. These threads contain answers which often overlap or contradict each other. In this work, we present  a hierarchical encoder based on structural attention to model such inter-sentence and inter-document dependencies. We set the popular pointer-generator architecture and some of the architectures derived from it as our baselines and show that they fail to generate good summaries in a multi-document setting. We further illustrate that our proposed model achieves significant improvement  over the baseline in both single and multi-document summarization settings -- in the former setting, it beats the  baseline by 1.31 and 7.8 ROUGE-1 points on CNN and CQA datasets, respectively; in the latter setting, the performance is further improved by   1.6 ROUGE-1 points on the CQA dataset."
21,Domain Adaptation for Semantic Parsing,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/515,"Recently, semantic parsing has attracted much attention in the community. Although many neural modeling efforts have greatly improved the performance, it still suffers from the data scarcity issue. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic parser for domain adaptation, where we have much fewer annotated data in the target domain compared to the source domain. Our semantic parser benefits from a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework, thus can provide different and accurate treatments for the two stages, i.e., focusing on domain invariant and domain specific information, respectively. In the coarse stage, our novel domain discrimination component and domain relevance attention encourage the model to learn transferable domain general structures. In the fine stage, the model is guided to concentrate on domain related details. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that our method consistently outperforms several popular domain adaptation strategies.  Additionally, we show that our model can well exploit limited target data to capture the difference between the source and target domain, even when the target domain has far fewer training instances."
22,Evaluating Natural Language Generation via Unbalanced Optimal Transport,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Machine Translation', 'Dialogue']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/516,"Embedding-based evaluation measures have shown promising improvements on the correlation with human judgments in natural language generation. In these measures, various intrinsic metrics are used in the computation, including generalized precision, recall, F-score and the earth mover's distance. However, the relations between these metrics are unclear, making it difficult to determine which measure to use in real applications. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study on the relations between these metrics. Inspired by the optimal transportation theory, we prove that these metrics correspond to the optimal transport problem with different hard marginal constraints. However, these hard marginal constraints may cause the problem of incomplete and noisy matching in the evaluation process. Therefore we propose a family of new evaluation metrics, namely Lazy Earth Mover's Distances, based on the more general unbalanced optimal transport problem. Experimental results on WMT18 and WMT19 show that our proposed metrics have the ability to produce more consistent evaluation results with human judgements, as compared with existing intrinsic metrics."
23,Modeling Topical Relevance for Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/517,"Topic drift is a common phenomenon in multi-turn dialogue. Therefore, an ideal dialogue generation models should be able to capture the topic information of each context, detect the relevant context, and produce appropriate responses accordingly. However, existing models usually use word or sentence level similarities to detect the relevant contexts, which fail to well capture the topical level relevance. In this paper, we propose a new model, named STAR-BTM, to tackle this problem. Firstly, the Biterm Topic Model is pre-trained on the whole training dataset. Then, the topic level attention weights are computed based on the topic representation of each context. Finally, the attention weights and the topic distribution are utilized in the decoding process to generate the corresponding responses. Experimental results on both Chinese customer services data and English Ubuntu dialogue data show that STAR-BTM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both metric-based and human evaluations."
24,Robust Front-End for Multi-Channel ASR using Flow-Based Density Estimation,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/518,"For multi-channel speech recognition, speech enhancement techniques such as denoising or dereverberation are conventionally applied as a front-end processor. Deep learning-based front-ends using such techniques require aligned clean and noisy speech pairs which are generally obtained via data simulation. Recently, several joint optimization techniques have been proposed to train the front-end without parallel data within an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) scheme. However, the ASR objective is sub-optimal and insufficient for fully training the front-end, which still leaves room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which incorporates flow-based density estimation for the robust front-end using non-parallel clean and noisy speech. Experimental results on the CHiME-4 dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional techniques where the front-end is trained only with ASR objective."
25,Formal Query Building with Query Structure Prediction for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/519,"Formal query building is an important part of complex question answering over knowledge bases. It aims to build correct executable queries for questions. Recent methods try to rank candidate queries generated by a state-transition strategy. However, this candidate generation strategy ignores the structure of queries, resulting in a considerable number of noisy queries. In this paper, we propose a new formal query building approach that consists of two stages. In the first stage, we predict the query structure of the question and leverage the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries. We propose a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined operation in each generative step. In the second stage, we follow the previous methods to rank the candidate queries. The experimental results show that our formal query building approach outperforms existing methods on complex questions while staying competitive on simple questions."
26,Towards Fully 8-bit Integer Inference for the Transformer Model,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Machine Translation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/520,"8-bit integer inference, as a promising direction in reducing both the latency and storage of deep neural networks, has made great progress recently. On the other hand, previous systems still rely on 32-bit floating point for certain functions in complex models (e.g., Softmax in Transformer), and make heavy use of quantization and de-quantization. In this work, we show that after a principled modification on the Transformer architecture, dubbed Integer Transformer, an (almost) fully 8-bit integer inference algorithm Scale Propagation could be derived. De-quantization is adopted when necessary, which makes the network more efficient. Our experiments on WMT16 En<->Ro, WMT14 En<->De and En->Fr translation tasks as well as the WikiText-103 language modelling task show that the fully 8-bit Transformer system achieves comparable performance with the floating point baseline but requires nearly 4x less memory footprint."
27,TopicKA: Generating Commonsense Knowledge-Aware Dialogue Responses Towards the Recommended Topic Fact,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/521,"Insufficient semantic understanding of dialogue always leads to the appearance of generic responses, in generative dialogue systems. Recently, high-quality knowledge bases have been introduced to enhance dialogue understanding, as well as to reduce the prevalence of boring responses. Although such knowledge-aware approaches have shown tremendous potential, they always utilize the knowledge in a black-box fashion. As a result, the generation process is somewhat uncontrollable, and it is also not interpretable. In this paper, we introduce a topic fact-based commonsense knowledge-aware approach, TopicKA. Different from previous works, TopicKA generates responses conditioned not only on the query message but also on a topic fact with an explicit semantic meaning, which also controls the direction of generation. Topic facts are recommended by a recommendation network trained under the Teacher-Student framework. To integrate the recommendation network and the generation network, this paper designs four schemes, which include two non-sampling schemes and two sampling methods. We collected and constructed a large-scale Chinese commonsense knowledge graph. Experimental results on an open Chinese benchmark dataset indicate that our model outperforms baselines in terms of both the objective and the subjective metrics."
28,Infobox-to-text Generation with Tree-like Planning based Attention Network,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/522,"We study the problem of infobox-to-text generation that aims to generate a textual description from a key-value table. Representing the input infobox as a sequence, previous neural methods using end-to-end models without order-planning suffer from the problems of incoherence and inadaptability to disordered input. Recent planning-based models only implement static order-planning to guide the generation, which may cause error propagation between planning and generation. To address these issues, we propose a Tree-like PLanning based Attention Network (Tree-PLAN) which leverages both static order-planning and dynamic tuning to guide the generation. A novel tree-like tuning encoder is designed to dynamically tune the static order-plan for better planning by merging the most relevant attributes together layer by layer. Experiments conducted on two datasets show that our model outperforms previous methods on both automatic and human evaluation, and demonstrate that our model has better adaptability to disordered input."
29,Triple-to-Text Generation with an Anchor-to-Prototype Framework,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Other']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/523,"Generating a textual description from a set of RDF triplets is a challenging task in natural language generation. Recent neural methods have become the mainstream for this task, which often generate sentences from scratch. However, due to the huge gap between the structured input and the unstructured output, the input triples alone are insufficient to decide an expressive and specific description. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-to-prototype framework to bridge the gap between structured RDF triples and natural text. The model retrieves a set of prototype descriptions from the training data and extracts writing patterns from them to guide the generation process. Furthermore, to make a more precise use of the retrieved prototypes, we employ a triple anchor that aligns the input triples into groups so as to better match the prototypes. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both automatic and manual evaluation, demonstrating the benefit of learning guidance from retrieved prototypes to facilitate triple-to-text generation."
30,Attention as Relation: Learning Supervised Multi-head Self-Attention for Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/524,"Joint entity and relation extraction is critical for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which has attracted increasing research interest. However, it is still faced with the challenges of identifying the overlapping relation triplets along with the entire entity boundary and detecting the multi-type relations. In this paper, we propose an attention-based joint model, which mainly contains an entity extraction module and a relation detection module, to address the challenges. The key of our model is devising a supervised multi-head self-attention mechanism as the relation detection module to learn the token-level correlation for each relation type separately. With the attention mechanism, our model can effectively identify overlapping relations and flexibly predict the relation type with its corresponding intensity. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances."
31,An Iterative Multi-Source Mutual Knowledge Transfer Framework for Machine Reading Comprehension,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/525,"The lack of sufficient training data in many domains, poses a major challenge to the construction of domain-specific machine reading comprehension (MRC) models with satisfying performance. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative multi-source mutual knowledge transfer framework for MRC. As an extension of the conventional knowledge transfer with one-to-one correspondence, our framework focuses on the many-to-many mutual transfer, which involves synchronous executions of multiple many-to-one transfers in an iterative manner.Specifically, to update a target-domain MRC model, we first consider other domain-specific MRC models as individual teachers, and employ knowledge distillation to train a multi-domain MRC model, which is differentially required to fit the training data and match the outputs of these individual models according to their domain-level similarities to the target domain. After being initialized by the multi-domain MRC model, the target-domain MRC model is fine-tuned to match both its training data and the output of its previous best model simultaneously via knowledge distillation. Compared with previous approaches, our framework can continuously enhance all domain-specific MRC models by enabling each model to iteratively and differentially absorb the domain-shared knowledge from others. Experimental results and in-depth analyses on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."
32,Text Style Transfer via Learning Style Instance Supported Latent Space,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/526,"Text style transfer pursues altering the style of a sentence while remaining its main content unchanged. Due to the lack of parallel corpora, most recent work focuses on unsupervised methods and has achieved noticeable progress. Nonetheless, the intractability of completely disentangling content from style for text leads to a contradiction of content preservation and style transfer accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a style instance supported method, StyIns. Instead of representing styles with embeddings or latent variables learned from single sentences, our model leverages the generative flow technique to extract underlying stylistic properties from multiple instances of each style, which form a more discriminative and expressive latent style space. By combining such a space with the attention-based structure, our model can better maintain the content and simultaneously achieve high transfer accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method can be flexibly extended to semi-supervised learning so as to utilize available limited paired data. Experiments on three transfer tasks, sentiment modification, formality rephrasing, and poeticness generation, show that StyIns obtains a better balance between content and style, outperforming several recent baselines."
33,Learning with Noise: Improving Distantly-Supervised Fine-grained Entity Typing via Automatic Relabeling,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/527,"Fine-grained entity typing (FET) is a fundamental task for various entity-leveraging applications. Although great success has been made, existing systems still have challenges in handling noisy samples in training data introduced by distant supervision methods. To address these noise, previous studies either focus on processing the clean samples (i,e., have only one label) and noisy samples (i,e., have multiple labels) with different strategies or filtering the noisy labels based on the assumption that the distantly-supervised label set certainly contains the correct type label. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic automatic relabeling method which treats all training samples uniformly. Our method aims to estimate the pseudo-truth label distribution of each sample, and the pseudo-truth distribution will be treated as part of trainable parameters which are jointly updated during the training process. The proposed approach does not rely on any prerequisite or extra supervision, making it effective on real applications. Experiments on several benchmarks show that our method outperforms previous approaches and alleviates the noisy labeling problem."
34,Joint Time-Frequency and Time Domain Learning for Speech Enhancement,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/528,"For single-channel speech enhancement, both time-domain and time-frequency-domain methods have their respective pros and cons. In this paper, we present a cross-domain framework named TFT-Net, which takes time-frequency spectrogram as input and produces time-domain waveform as output. Such a framework takes advantage of the knowledge we have about spectrogram and avoids some of the drawbacks that T-F-domain methods have been suffering from. In TFT-Net, we design an innovative dual-path attention block (DAB) to fully exploit correlations along the time and frequency axes. We further discover that a sample-independent DAB (SDAB) achieves a good tradeoff between enhanced speech quality and complexity. Ablation studies show that both the cross-domain design and the SDAB block bring large performance gain. When logarithmic MSE is used as the training criteria, TFT-Net achieves the highest SDR and SSNR among state-of-the-art methods on two major speech enhancement benchmarks."
35,Answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/529,"Machine reading comprehension methods that gen- erate answers by referring to multiple passages for a question have gained much attention in AI and NLP communities. The current methods, however, do not investigate the relationships among multi- ple passages in the answer generation process, even though topics correlated among the passages may be answer candidates. Our method, called neural answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages (GUM-MP), solves this problem as follows. First, it determines which tokens in the passages are matched to the question. In particular, it investigates matches between tokens in positive passages, which are assigned to the question, and those in negative passages, which are not related to the question. Next, it determines which tokens in the passage are matched to other passages assigned to the same question and at the same time it investi- gates the topics in which they are matched. Finally, it encodes the token sequences with the above two matching results into unified memories in the pas- sage encoders and learns the answer sequence by using an encoder-decoder with a multiple-pointer- generator mechanism. As a result, GUM-MP can generate answers by pointing to important tokens present across passages. Evaluations indicate that GUM-MP generates much more accurate results than the current models do."
36,On the Importance of Word and Sentence Representation Learning in Implicit Discourse Relation Classification,Main,['Discourse'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/530,"Implicit discourse relation classification is one of the most difficult parts in shallow discourse parsing as the relation prediction without explicit connectives requires the language understanding at both the text span level and the sentence level. Previous studies mainly focus on the interactions between two arguments.  We argue that a powerful contextualized representation module, a bilateral multi-perspective matching module, and a global information fusion module are all important to implicit discourse analysis. We propose a novel model to combine these modules together. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms BERT and other state-of-the-art systems on the PDTB dataset by around 8% and CoNLL 2016 datasets around 16%.  We also analyze the effectiveness of different modules in the implicit discourse relation classification task and demonstrate how different levels of representation learning can affect the results."

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach based upon a novel label propagation scheme, which, by jointly leveraging contextualized word embeddings and the multilingual information enclosed in a knowledge base, projects sense labels from a high-resource language, i.e., English, to lower-resourced ones. Backed by several experiments, we provide empirical evidence that our automatically created datasets are of a higher quality than those generated by other competitors and lead a supervised model to achieve state-of-the-art performances in all multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation tasks. We make our datasets available for research purposes at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/mulan."
38,Dialogue State Induction Using Neural Latent Variable Models,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/532,"Dialogue state modules are a useful component in a task-oriented dialogue system. Traditional methods find dialogue states by manually labeling training corpora, upon which neural models are trained. However, the labeling process can be costly, slow, error-prone, and more importantly, cannot cover the vast range of domains in real-world dialogues for customer service. We propose the task of dialogue state induction, building two neural latent variable models that mine dialogue states automatically from unlabeled customer service dialogue records. Results show that the models can effectively find meaningful dialogue states. In addition, equipped with induced dialogue states, a state-of-the-art dialogue system gives better performance compared with not using a dialogue state module."
39,CoSDA-ML: Multi-Lingual Code-Switching Data Augmentation  for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual NLP,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/533,"Multi-lingual contextualized embeddings, such as multilingual-BERT (mBERT), have shown success in a variety of zero-shot cross-lingual tasks. However, these models are limited by having inconsistent contextualized representations of subwords across different languages. Existing work addresses this issue by bilingual projection and fine-tuning technique. We propose a data augmentation framework to generate multi-lingual code-switching data to fine-tune mBERT, which encourages model to align representations from source and multiple target languages once by mixing their context information. Compared with the existing work, our method does not rely on bilingual sentences for training, and requires only one training process for multiple target languages.   Experimental results on five tasks with 19 languages show that our method leads to significantly improved performances for all the tasks compared with mBERT."
40,Task-Level Curriculum Learning for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/534,"Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) achieves faster inference speed but at the cost of worse accuracy compared with autoregressive translation (AT). Since AT and NAT can share model structure and AT is an easier task than NAT due to the explicit dependency on previous target-side tokens, a natural idea is to gradually shift the model training from the easier AT task to the harder NAT task. To smooth the shift from AT training to NAT training, in this paper, we introduce semi-autoregressive translation (SAT) as intermediate tasks. SAT contains a hyperparameter k, and each k value defines a SAT task with different degrees of parallelism. Specially, SAT covers AT and NAT as its special cases: it reduces to AT when k=1 and to NAT when k=N (N is the length of target sentence). We design curriculum schedules to gradually shift k from 1 to N, with different pacing functions and number of tasks trained at the same time. We called our method as task-level curriculum learning for NAT (TCL-NAT). Experiments on IWSLT14 De-En, IWSLT16 En-De, WMT14 En-De and De-En datasets show that TCL-NAT achieves significant accuracy improvements over previous NAT baselines and reduces the performance gap between NAT and AT models to 1-2 BLEU points, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method."
41,End-to-End Transition-Based Online Dialogue Disentanglement,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Information Extraction', 'Information Retrieval']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/535,"Dialogue disentanglement aims to separate intermingled messages into detached sessions. The existing research focuses on two-step architectures, in which a model first retrieves the relationships between two messages and then divides the message stream into separate clusters. Almost all existing work puts significant efforts on selecting features for message-pair classification and clustering, while ignoring the semantic coherence within each session. In this paper, we introduce the first end-to- end transition-based model for online dialogue disentanglement. Our model captures the sequential information of each session as the online algorithm proceeds on processing a dialogue. The coherence in a session is hence modeled when messages are sequentially added into their best-matching sessions. Meanwhile, the research field still lacks data for studying end-to-end dialogue disentanglement, so we construct a large-scale dataset by extracting coherent dialogues from online movie scripts. We evaluate our model on both the dataset we developed and the publicly available Ubuntu IRC dataset [Kummerfeld et al., 2019]. The results show that our model significantly outperforms the existing algorithms. Further experiments demonstrate that our model better captures the sequential semantics and obtains more coherent disentangled sessions."

This paper focuses on discourse element (i.e., functions of sentences and paragraphs) based organization evaluation. Existing approaches mostly separate discourse element identification and organization evaluation. In contrast,  we propose a neural hierarchical multi-task learning approach for jointly optimizing sentence and paragraph level discourse element identification and organization evaluation. We represent the organization as a grid to simulate the visual layout of an essay and integrate discourse elements at multiple linguistic levels. Experimental results show that the multi-task learning based organization evaluation can achieve significant improvements compared with existing work and pipeline baselines.  Multiple level discourse element identification also benefits from multi-task learning through mutual enhancement."
43,Transformers as Soft Reasoners over Language,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/537,"Beginning with McCarthy's Advice Taker (1959), AI has pursued the goal of providing a system with explicit, general knowledge and having the system reason over that knowledge. However, expressing the knowledge in a formal (logical or probabilistic) representation has been a major obstacle to this research. This paper investigates a modern approach to this problem where the facts and rules are provided as natural language sentences, thus bypassing a formal representation. We train transformers to reason (or emulate reasoning) over these sentences using synthetically generated data. Our models, that we call RuleTakers, provide the first empirical demonstration that this kind of soft reasoning over language is learnable, can achieve high (99%) accuracy, and generalizes to test data requiring substantially deeper chaining than seen during training (95%+ scores). We also demonstrate that the models transfer well to two hand-authored rulebases, and to rulebases paraphrased into more natural language. These findings are significant as it suggests a new role for transformers, namely as limited ""soft theorem provers"" operating over explicit theories in language. This in turn suggests new possibilities for explainability, correctability, and counterfactual reasoning in question-answering."
44,Neural Machine Translation with Error Correction,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/538,"Neural machine translation (NMT) generates the next target token given as input the previous ground truth target tokens during training while the previous generated target tokens during inference, which causes discrepancy between training and inference as well as error propagation, and affects the translation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce an error correction mechanism into NMT, which corrects the error information in the previous generated tokens to better predict the next token. Specifically, we introduce two-stream self-attention from XLNet into NMT decoder, where the query stream is used to predict the next token, and meanwhile the content stream is used to correct the error information from the previous predicted tokens. We leverage scheduled sampling to simulate the prediction errors during training. Experiments on three IWSLT translation datasets and two WMT translation datasets demonstrate that our method achieves improvements over Transformer baseline and scheduled sampling. Further experimental analyses also verify the effectiveness of our proposed error correction mechanism to improve the translation quality."
45,Alleviate Dataset Shift Problem in Fine-grained Entity Typing with Virtual Adversarial Training,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/539,"The recent success of Distant Supervision (DS) brings abundant labeled data for the task of fine-grained entity typing (FET) without human annotation. However, the heuristically generated labels inevitably bring a significant distribution gap, namely dataset shift, between the distantly labeled training set and the manually curated test set. Considerable efforts have been made to alleviate this problem from the label perspective by either intelligently denoising the training labels, or designing noise-aware loss functions. Despite their progress, the dataset shift can hardly be eliminated completely. In this work, complementary to the label perspective, we reconsider this problem from the model perspective: Can we learn a more robust typing model with the existence of dataset shift? To this end, we propose a novel regularization module based on virtual adversarial training (VAT). The proposed approach first uses a self-paced sample selection function to select suitable samples for VAT, then constructs virtual adversarial perturbations based on the selected samples, and finally regularizes the model to be robust to such perturbations. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with an average 3.8%, 2.5%, and 3.2% improvement in accuracy, Macro F1 and Micro F1 respectively compared to the next best method."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this multi-hop reading comprehension problem. Inspired by the human reasoning processing, we introduce a path-based graph with reasoning paths which extracted from supporting documents. The path-based graph can combine both the idea of the graph-based  and path-based approaches, so it is better for multi-hop reasoning. Meanwhile, we propose Gated-GCN to accumulate evidences on the path-based graph, which contains a new question-aware gating mechanism to regulate the usefulness of information propagating across documents and add question information during reasoning. We evaluate our approach on WikiHop dataset, and our approach achieves the the-state-of-art accuracy against previous published approaches. Especially, our ensemble model surpasses the human performance by 4.2%."
47,Gaussian Embedding of Linked Documents from a Pretrained Semantic Space,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/541,"Gaussian Embedding of Linked Documents (GELD) is a new method that embeds linked documents (e.g., citation networks) onto a pretrained semantic space (e.g., a set of word embeddings). We formulate the problem in such a way that we model each document as a Gaussian distribution in the word vector space. We design a generative model that combines both words and links in a consistent way. Leveraging the variance of a document allows us to model the uncertainty related to word and link generation. In most cases, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when using our document vectors as features for usual downstream tasks. In particular, GELD achieves better accuracy in classification and link prediction on Cora and Dblp. In addition, we demonstrate qualitatively the convenience of several properties of our method. We provide the implementation of GELD and the evaluation datasets to the community (https://github.com/AntoineGourru/DNEmbedding)."

Recent studies formalize this task a graph-to-sequence learning problem and use various graph neural networks to model graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that generates texts from AMR graphs while reconstructing the input graph structures. Our model employs graph attention mechanism to aggregate information for encoding the inputs. Moreover, better node representations are learned by optimizing two simple but effective auxiliary reconstruction objectives: link prediction objective which requires predicting the semantic relationship between nodes, and distance prediction objective which requires predicting the distance between nodes. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed model improves considerably over strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art."
49,UniTrans : Unifying Model Transfer and Data Transfer for Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition with Unlabeled Data,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/543,"Prior work in cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) with no/little labeled data falls into two primary categories: model transfer- and data transfer-based methods. In this paper, we find that both method types can complement each other, in the sense that, the former can exploit context information via language-independent features but sees no task-specific information in the target language; while the latter generally generates pseudo target-language training data via translation but its exploitation of context information is weakened by inaccurate translations. Moreover, prior work rarely leverages unlabeled data in the target language, which can be effortlessly collected and potentially contains valuable information for improved results. To handle both problems, we propose a novel approach termed UniTrans to Unify both model and data Transfer for cross-lingual NER, and furthermore, leverage the available information from unlabeled target-language data via enhanced knowledge distillation. We evaluate our proposed UniTrans over 4 target languages on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that it substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods."
50,Efficient Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation with Layer-Wise Weighting and Input-Aware Gating,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/544,"Existing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are generally trained on a large amount of sentence-level parallel data, and during prediction sentences are independently translated, ignoring cross-sentence contextual information. This leads to inconsistency between translated sentences. In order to address this issue, context-aware models have been proposed. However, document-level parallel data constitutes only a small part of the parallel data available, and many approaches build context-aware models based on a pre-trained frozen sentence-level translation model in a two-step training manner. The computational cost of these approaches is usually high. In this paper, we propose to make the most of layers pre-trained on sentence-level data in contextual representation learning, reusing representations from the sentence-level Transformer and significantly reducing the cost of incorporating contexts in translation. We find that representations from shallow layers of a pre-trained sentence-level encoder play a vital role in source context encoding, and propose to perform source context encoding upon weighted combinations of pre-trained encoder layers' outputs. Instead of separately performing source context and input encoding, we propose to iteratively and jointly encode the source input and its contexts and to generate input-aware context representations with a cross-attention layer and a gating mechanism, which resets irrelevant information in context encoding. Our context-aware Transformer model outperforms the recent CADec [Voita et al., 2019c] on the English-Russian subtitle data and is about twice as fast in training and decoding."

Previous work on knowledge grounded conversation generation focus on improving dialog informativeness with little attention on dialog coherence. In this paper, to enhance multi-turn dialog coherence, we propose to leverage event chains to help determine a sketch of a multi-turn dialog. We first extract event chains from narrative texts and connect them as a graph. We then present a novel event graph grounded Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. It conducts high-level response content (simply an event) planning by learning to walk over the graph, and then produces a response conditioned on the planned content. In particular, we devise a novel multi-policy decision making mechanism to foster a coherent dialog with both appropriate content ordering and high contextual relevance. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this framework in terms of dialog coherence and informativeness."
52,Asking Effective and Diverse Questions: A Machine Reading Comprehension based Framework for Joint Entity-Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/546,"Recent advances cast the entity-relation extraction to a multi-turn question answering (QA) task and provide an effective solution based on the machine reading comprehension (MRC) models. However, they use a single question to characterize the meaning of entities and relations, which is intuitively not enough because of the variety of context semantics. Meanwhile, existing models enumerate all relation types to generate questions, which is inefficient and easily leads to confusing questions. In this paper, we improve the existing MRC-based entity-relation extraction model through diverse question answering. First, a diversity question answering mechanism is introduced to detect entity spans and two answering selection strategies are designed to integrate different answers. Then, we propose to predict a subset of potential relations and filter out irrelevant ones to generate questions effectively. Finally, entity and relation extractions are integrated in an end-to-end way and optimized through joint learning. Experiment results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models, which improves the relation F1 to 62.1% (+1.9%) on ACE05 and 71.9% (+3.0%) on CoNLL04.

Recent efforts have focused on generating paraphrases in specific syntactic forms, which, generally, heavily relies on manually annotated paraphrase data that is not easily available for many languages and domains. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to leverage existing large-scale bilingual parallel corpora to generate paraphrases under the control of syntactic exemplars. In order to train one model over the two languages of parallel corpora, we embed sentences of them into the same content and style spaces with shared content and style encoders using cross-lingual word embeddings. We propose an adversarial discriminator to disentangle the content and style space, and employ a latent variable to model the syntactic style of a given exemplar in order to guide the two decoders for generation. Additionally, we introduce cycle and masking learning schemes to efficiently train the model. Experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed model trained only on bilingual parallel data is capable of generating diverse paraphrases with desirable syntactic styles. Fine-tuning the trained model on a small paraphrase corpus makes it substantially outperform state-of-the-art paraphrase generation models trained on a larger paraphrase dataset."
54,A Structured Latent Variable Recurrent Network With Stochastic Attention For Generating Weibo Comments,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/548,"Building intelligent agents to generate realistic Weibo comments is challenging. For such realistic Weibo comments, the key criterion is improving diversity while maintaining coherency. Considering that the variability of linguistic comments arises from multi-level sources, including both discourse-level properties and word-level selections, we improve the comment diversity by leveraging such inherent hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a structured latent variable recurrent network, which exploits the hierarchical-structured latent variables with stochastic attention to model the variations of comments. First, we endow both discourse-level and word-level latent variables with hierarchical and temporal dependencies for constructing multi-level hierarchy. Second, we introduce a stochastic attention to infer the key-words of interest in the input post. As a result, diverse comments can be generated with both discourse-level properties and local-word selections. Experiments on open-domain Weibo data show that our model generates more diverse and realistic comments."
55,Dataless Short Text Classification Based on Biterm Topic Model and Word Embeddings,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/549,"Dataless text classification has attracted increasing attentions recently. It only needs very few seed words of each category to classify documents, which is much cheaper than supervised text classification that requires massive labeling efforts. However, most of existing models pay attention to long texts, but get unsatisfactory performance on short texts, which have become increasingly popular on the Internet. In this paper, we at first propose a novel model named Seeded Biterm Topic Model (SeedBTM) extending BTM to solve the problem of dataless short text classification with seed words. It takes advantage of both word co-occurrence information in the topic model and category-word similarity from widely used word embeddings as the prior topic-in-set knowledge. Moreover, with the same approach, we also propose Seeded Twitter Biterm Topic Model (SeedTBTM), which extends Twitter-BTM and utilizes additional user information to achieve higher classification accuracy. Experimental results on five real short-text datasets show that our models outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and especially perform well when the categories are overlapping and interrelated."

Previous work focused on better context representations and used the CRF for label decoding. However, CRF-based methods are inadequate for modeling document-level label consistency. This work introduces a novel two-stage label refinement approach to handle document-level label consistency, where a key-value memory network is first used to record draft labels predicted by the base model, and then a multi-channel Transformer makes refinements on these draft predictions based on the explicit co-occurrence relationship derived from the memory network. In addition, in order to mitigate the side effects of incorrect draft labels, Bayesian neural networks are used to indicate the labels with a high probability of being wrong, which can greatly assist in preventing the incorrect refinement of correct draft labels. The experimental results on three named entity recognition benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods."

We argue that previous research did not make a clear use of the global context, and propose a new document-level NMT framework that deliberately models the local context of each sentence with the awareness of the global context of the document in both source and target languages. We specifically design the model to be able to deal with documents containing any number of sentences, including single sentences. This unified approach allows our model to be trained elegantly on standard datasets without needing to train on sentence and document level data separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms Transformer baselines and previous document-level NMT models with substantial margins of up to 2.1 BLEU on state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide analyses which show the benefit of context far beyond the neighboring two or three sentences, which previous studies have typically incorporated."

Recent research demonstrates its odds of capturing complex hierarchical structures with its exceptional high capacity and continuous tree-like properties. This paper bridges hyperbolic space's superiority to the power-law structure of documents by introducing a hyperbolic neural network architecture named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Attention Network (Hype-HAN). Hype-HAN defines three levels of embeddings (word/sentence/document) and two layers of hyperbolic attention mechanism (word-to-sentence/sentence-to-document) on Riemannian geometries of the Lorentz model, Klein model and Poincaré model. Situated on the evolving embedding spaces, we utilize both conventional GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) and hyperbolic GRUs with Möbius operations. Hype-HAN is applied to large scale datasets. The empirical experiments show the effectiveness of our method."

To address this issue, we propose an enhanced multi-flow sequence to sequence pre-training and fine-tuning framework named ERNIE-GEN, which bridges the discrepancy between training and inference with an infilling generation mechanism and a noise-aware generation method. To make generation closer to human writing patterns, this framework introduces a span-by-span generation flow that trains the model to predict semantically-complete spans consecutively rather than predicting word by word. Unlike existing pre-training methods, ERNIE-GEN incorporates multi-granularity target sampling to construct pre-training data, which enhances the correlation between encoder and decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE-GEN achieves state-of-the-art results with a much smaller amount of pre-training data and parameters on a range of language generation tasks, including abstractive summarization (Gigaword and CNN/DailyMail), question generation (SQuAD), dialogue generation (Persona-Chat) and generative question answering (CoQA).

61,Teacher-Student Networks with Multiple Decoders for Solving Math Word Problem,Main,"['Natural Language Generation', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/555,"Math word problem (MWP) is challenging due to the limitation in training data where only one “standard” solution is available. MWP models often simply fit this solution rather than truly understand or solve the problem. The generalization of models (to diverse word scenarios) is thus limited. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach, TSN-MD, by leveraging the teacher network to integrate the knowledge of equivalent solution expressions and then to regularize the learning behavior of the student network. In addition, we introduce the multiple-decoder student network to generate multiple candidate solution expressions by which the final answer is voted. In experiments, we conduct extensive comparisons and ablative studies on two large-scale MWP benchmarks, and show that using TSN-MD can surpass the state-of-the-art works by a large margin. More intriguingly, the visualization results demonstrate that TSN-MD not only produces correct final answers but also generates diverse equivalent expressions of the solution."
62,Generalized Zero-Shot Text Classification for ICD Coding,Main,"['Text Classification', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/556,"The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a list of classification codes for the diagnoses. Automatic ICD coding is a multi-label text classification problem with noisy clinical document inputs and long-tailed label distribution, making it difficult for fine-grained classification on both frequent and zero-shot codes at the same time, i.e. generalized zero-shot ICD coding. In this paper, we propose a latent feature generation framework to improve the prediction on unseen codes without compromising the performance on seen codes. Our framework generates semantically meaningful features for zero-shot codes by exploiting ICD code hierarchical structure and reconstructing the code-relevant keywords with a novel cycle architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adversarial generative model for generalized zero-shot learning on multi-label text classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the public MIMIC-III dataset, our methods improve the F1 score from nearly 0 to 20.91% for the zero-shot codes, and increase the AUC score by 3% (absolute improvement) from previous state of the art. Code is available at https://github.com/csong27/gzsl_text."
63,Gated POS-Level Language Model for Authorship Verification,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Other']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/557,"Authorship verification is an important problem that has many applications. The state-of-the-art deep authorship verification methods typically leverage character-level language models to encode author-specific writing styles. However, they often fail to capture syntactic level patterns, leading to sub-optimal accuracy in cross-topic scenarios. Also, due to imperfect cross-author parameter sharing, it's difficult for them to distinguish author-specific writing style from common patterns, leading to data-inefficient learning.  This paper introduces a novel POS-level (Part of Speech) gated RNN based language model to effectively learn the author-specific syntactic styles. The author-agnostic syntactic information obtained from the POS tagger pre-trained on large external datasets greatly reduces the number of effective parameters of our model, enabling the model to learn accurate author-specific syntactic styles with limited training data. We also utilize a gated architecture to learn the common syntactic writing styles with a small set of shared parameters and let the author-specific parameters focus on each author's special syntactic styles. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves significantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art competing methods, especially in cross-topic scenarios (over 5\% in terms of AUC-ROC)."
64,Modeling Dense Cross-Modal Interactions for Joint Entity-Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/558,"Joint extraction of entities and their relations benefits from the close interaction between named entities and their relation information. Therefore, how to effectively model such cross-modal interactions is critical for the final performance. Previous works have used simple methods such as label-feature concatenation to perform coarse-grained semantic fusion among cross-modal instances, but fail to capture fine-grained correlations over token and label spaces, resulting in insufficient interactions. In this paper, we propose a deep Cross-Modal Attention Network (CMAN) for joint entity and relation extraction. The network is carefully constructed by stacking multiple attention units in depth to fully model dense interactions over token-label spaces, in which two basic attention units are proposed to explicitly capture fine-grained correlations across different modalities (e.g., token-to-token and labelto-token). Experiment results on CoNLL04 dataset show that our model obtains state-of-the-art results by achieving 90.62% F1 on entity recognition and 72.97% F1 on relation classification. In ADE dataset, our model surpasses existing approaches by more than 1.9% F1 on relation classification. Extensive analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our approach."
65,Knowledge Graphs Enhanced Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/559,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) store much structured information on various entities, many of which are not covered by the parallel sentence pairs of neural machine translation (NMT). To improve the translation quality of these entities, in this paper we propose a novel KGs enhanced NMT method. Specifically, we first induce the new translation results of these entities by transforming the source and target KGs into a unified semantic space. We then generate adequate pseudo parallel sentence pairs that contain these induced entity pairs. Finally, NMT model is jointly trained by the original and pseudo sentence pairs. The extensive experiments on Chinese-to-English and Englishto-Japanese translation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the strong baseline models in translation quality, especially in handling the induced entities."
66,Fast and Accurate Neural CRF Constituency Parsing,Main,"['Tagging, chunking, and parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/560,"Estimating probability distribution is one of the core issues in the NLP field.  However, in both deep learning (DL) and pre-DL eras, unlike the vast applications of linear-chain CRF in sequence labeling tasks, very few works have applied tree-structure CRF to constituency parsing, mainly due to the complexity and inefficiency of the inside-outside algorithm. This work presents a fast and accurate neural CRF constituency parser.  The key idea is to batchify the inside algorithm for loss computation by direct large tensor operations on GPU, and meanwhile avoid the outside algorithm for gradient computation via efficient back-propagation. We also propose a simple two-stage bracketing-then-labeling parsing approach to improve efficiency further. To improve the parsing performance, inspired by recent progress in dependency parsing, we introduce a new scoring architecture based on boundary representation and biaffine attention, and a beneficial dropout strategy. Experiments on PTB, CTB5.1, and CTB7 show that our two-stage CRF parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both settings of w/o and w/ BERT, and can parse over 1,000 sentences per second. We release our code at https://github.com/yzhangcs/crfpar."
67,A Relation-Specific Attention Network for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/561,"Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in natural language processing (NLP), which aims to capture all relational triplets from plain texts. This is a big challenge due to some of the triplets extracted from one sentence may have overlapping entities. Most existing methods perform entity recognition followed by relation detection between every possible entity pairs, which usually suffers from numerous redundant operations. In this paper, we propose a relation-specific attention network (RSAN) to handle the issue. Our RSAN utilizes relation-aware attention mechanism to construct specific sentence representations for each relation, and then performs sequence labeling to extract its corresponding head and tail entities. Experiments on two public datasets show that our model can effectively extract overlapping triplets and achieve state-of-the-art performance."
