0,Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Opinion Tree Generation,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/561,"Existing studies usually extract these sentiment elements by decomposing the complex structure prediction task into multiple subtasks. Despite their effectiveness, these methods ignore the semantic structure in ABSA problems and require extensive task-specific designs. In this study, we introduce an Opinion Tree Generation task, which aims to jointly detect all sentiment elements in a tree. We believe that the opinion tree can reveal a more comprehensive and complete aspect-level sentiment structure. Furthermore, we propose a pre-trained model to integrate both syntax and semantic features for opinion tree generation. On one hand, a pre-trained model with large-scale unlabeled data is important for the tree generation model. On the other hand, the syntax and semantic features are very effective for forming the opinion tree structure.  Extensive experiments show the superiority of our proposed method. The results also validate the tree structure is effective to generate sentimental elements."
1,Speaker-Guided Encoder-Decoder Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversation,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification', 'Applications']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/562,"The emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) task aims to predict the emotion label of an utterance in a conversation. Since the dependencies between speakers are complex and dynamic, which consist of intra- and inter-speaker dependencies, the modeling of speaker-specific information is a vital role in ERC. Although existing researchers have proposed various methods of speaker interaction modeling, they cannot explore dynamic intra- and inter-speaker dependencies jointly, leading to the insufficient comprehension of context and further hindering emotion prediction. To this end, we design a novel speaker modeling scheme that explores intra- and inter-speaker dependencies jointly in a dynamic manner. Besides, we propose a Speaker-Guided Encoder-Decoder (SGED) framework for ERC, which fully exploits speaker information for the decoding of emotion. We use different existing methods as the conversational context encoder of our framework, showing the high scalability and flexibility of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SGED."
2,Learning Meta Word Embeddings by Unsupervised Weighted Concatenation of Source Embeddings,Main,"['Embeddings', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/563,"Given multiple source word embeddings learnt using diverse algorithms and lexical resources, meta word embedding learning methods attempt to learn more accurate and wide-coverage word embeddings.  Prior work on meta-embedding has repeatedly discovered that simple vector concatenation of the source embeddings to be a competitive baseline.  However, it remains unclear as to why and when simple vector concatenation can produce accurate meta-embeddings.  We show that weighted concatenation can be seen as a spectrum matching operation between each source embedding and the meta-embedding, minimising the pairwise inner-product loss. Following this theoretical analysis, we propose two \emph{unsupervised} methods to learn the optimal concatenation weights for creating meta-embeddings from a given set of source embeddings. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed weighted concatenated meta-embedding methods outperform previously proposed meta-embedding learning methods."
3,PCVAE: Generating Prior Context for Dialogue Response Generation,Main,"['Language Generation', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/564,"Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) is promising for modeling one-to-many relationships in dialogue generation, as it can naturally generate many responses from a given context. However, the conventional used continual latent variables in CVAE are more likely to generate generic rather than distinct and specific responses. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel discrete variable called prior context which enables the generation of favorable responses. Specifically, we present Prior Context VAE (PCVAE), a hierarchical VAE that learns prior context from data automatically for dialogue generation. Meanwhile, we design Active Codeword Transport (ACT) to help the model actively discover potential prior context. Moreover, we propose Autoregressive Compatible Arrangement (ACA) that enables modeling prior context in autoregressive style, which is crucial for selecting appropriate prior context according to a given context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCVAE can generate distinct responses and significantly outperforms strong baselines."
4,Towards Joint Intent Detection and Slot Filling via Higher-order Attention,Main,"['Applications', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/565,"Recently, attention-based models for joint intent detection and slot filling have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, we think the conventional attention can only capture the first-order feature interaction between two tasks and is insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a unified BiLinear attention block, which leverages bilinear pooling to synchronously explore both the contextual and channel-wise bilinear attention distributions to capture the second-order interactions between the input intent and slot features. Higher-order interactions are constructed by combining many such blocks and exploiting Exponential Linear activations. Furthermore, we present a Higher-order Attention Network (HAN) to jointly model them. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art results. We also conduct experiments on the new SLURP dataset, and give a discussion on HAN’s properties, i.e., robustness and generalization."
5,Effective Graph Context Representation for Document-level Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/566,"Document-level neural machine translation (DocNMT) universally encodes several local sentences or the entire document. Thus, DocNMT does not consider the relevance of document-level contextual information, for example, some context (i.e., content words, logical order, and co-occurrence relation) is more effective than another auxiliary context  (i.e., functional and auxiliary words). To address this issue, we first utilize the word frequency information to recognize content words in the input document, and then use heuristical relations to summarize content words and sentences as a graph structure without relying on external syntactic knowledge. Furthermore, we apply graph attention networks to this graph structure to learn its feature representation, which allows DocNMT to more effectively capture the document-level context. Experimental results on several widely-used document-level benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
6,DictBERT: Dictionary Description Knowledge Enhanced Language Model Pre-training via Contrastive Learning,Main,"['Language Models', 'Applications', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Question Answering', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/567,"Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they are shown to be lacking in knowledge when dealing with knowledge driven tasks. Despite the many efforts made for injecting knowledge into PLMs, this problem remains open. To address the challenge, we propose DictBERT, a novel approach that enhances PLMs with dictionary knowledge which is easier to acquire than knowledge graph (KG). During pre-training, we present two novel pre-training tasks to inject dictionary knowledge into PLMs via contrastive learning: dictionary entry prediction and entry description discrimination. In fine-tuning, we use the pre-trained DictBERT as a plugin knowledge base (KB) to retrieve implicit knowledge for identified entries in an input sequence, and infuse the retrieved knowledge into the input to enhance its representation via a novel extra-hop attention mechanism. We evaluate our approach on a variety of knowledge driven and language understanding tasks, including NER, relation extraction, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and GLUE. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve typical PLMs: it gains a substantial improvement of 0.5%, 2.9%, 9.0%, 7.1% and 3.3% on BERT-large respectively, and is also effective on RoBERTa-large."
7,Interpretable AMR-Based Question Decomposition for Multi-hop Question Answering,Main,"['Question Answering', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/568,"Effective multi-hop question answering (QA) requires reasoning over multiple scattered paragraphs and providing explanations for answers. Most existing approaches cannot provide an interpretable reasoning process to illustrate how these models arrive at an answer. In this paper, we propose a Question Decomposition method based on Abstract Meaning Representation (QDAMR) for multi-hop QA, which achieves interpretable reasoning by decomposing a multi-hop question into simpler subquestions and answering them in order. Since annotating the decomposition is expensive, we first delegate the complexity of understanding the multi-hop question to an AMR parser. We then achieve decomposition of a multi-hop question via segmentation of the corresponding AMR graph based on the required reasoning type. Finally, we generate sub-questions using an AMR-to-Text generation model and answer them with an off-the-shelf QA model. Experimental results on HotpotQA demonstrate that our approach is competitive for interpretable reasoning and that the sub-questions generated by QDAMR are well-formed, outperforming existing question-decomposition-based multihop QA approaches."
8,Interactive Information Extraction by Semantic Information Graph,Main,"['Applications', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/569,"Information extraction (IE) mainly focuses on three highly correlated subtasks, i.e., entity extraction, relation extraction and event extraction. Recently, there are studies using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to utilize the intrinsic correlations among these three subtasks. AMR based models are capable of building the relationship of arguments. However, they are hard to deal with relations. In addition, the noises of AMR (i.e., tags unrelated to IE tasks, nodes with unconcerned conception, and edge types with complicated hierarchical structures) disturb the decoding processing of IE. As a result, the decoding processing limited by the AMR cannot be worked effectively. To overcome the shortages, we propose an Interactive Information Extraction (InterIE) model based on a novel Semantic Information Graph (SIG). SIG can guide our InterIE model to tackle the three subtasks jointly. Furthermore, the well-designed SIG without noise is capable of enriching entity and event trigger representation, and capturing the edge connection between the information types. Experimental results show that our InterIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on all IE subtasks on the benchmark dataset (i.e., ACE05-E+ and ACE05-E). More importantly, the proposed model is not sensitive to the decoding order, which goes beyond the limitations of AMR based methods."
9,Global Inference with Explicit Syntactic and Discourse Structures for Dialogue-Level Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/570,"Recent research attention for relation extraction has been paid to the dialogue scenario, i.e., dialogue-level relation extraction (DiaRE). Existing DiaRE methods either simply concatenate the utterances in a dialogue into a long piece of text, or employ naive words, sentences or entities to build dialogue graphs, while the structural characteristics in dialogues have not been fully utilized. In this work, we investigate a novel dialogue-level mixed dependency graph (D2G) and an argument reasoning graph (ARG) for DiaRE with a global relation reasoning mechanism. First, we model the entire dialogue into a unified and coherent D2G by explicitly integrating both syntactic and discourse structures, which enables richer semantic and feature learning for relation extraction. Second, we stack an ARG graph on top of D2G to further focus on argument inter-dependency learning and argument representation refinement, for sufficient argument relation inference. In our global reasoning framework, D2G and ARG work collaboratively, iteratively performing lexical, syntactic and semantic information exchange and representation learning over the entire dialogue context. On two DiaRE benchmarks, our framework shows considerable improvements over the current state-of-the-art baselines. Further analyses show that the model effectively solves the long-range dependence issue, and meanwhile gives explainable predictions."
10,Conversational Semantic Role Labeling with Predicate-Oriented Latent Graph,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/571,"Conversational semantic role labeling (CSRL) is a newly proposed task that uncovers the shallow semantic structures in a dialogue text. Unfortunately several important characteristics of the CSRL task have been overlooked by the existing works, such as the structural information integration, near-neighbor influence. In this work, we investigate the integration of a latent graph for CSRL. We propose to automatically induce a predicate-oriented latent graph (POLar) with a predicate-centered gaussian mechanism, by which the nearer and informative words to the predicate will be allocated with more attention. The POLar structure is then dynamically pruned and refined so as to best fit the task need. We additionally introduce an effective dialogue-level pre-trained language model, CoDiaBERT, for better supporting multiple utterance sentences and handling the speaker coreference issue in CSRL. Our system outperforms best-performing baselines on three benchmark CSRL datasets with big margins, especially achieving over 4% F1 score improvements on the cross-utterance argument detection. Further analyses are presented to better understand the effectiveness of our proposed methods."
11,Inheriting the Wisdom of Predecessors: A Multiplex Cascade Framework for Unified Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Information Extraction', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/572,"So far, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has involved with total seven subtasks, in which, however the interactions among them have been left unexplored sufficiently. This work presents a novel multiplex cascade framework for unified ABSA and maintaining such interactions. First, we model total seven subtasks as a hierarchical dependency in the easy-to-hard order, based on which we then propose a multiplex decoding mechanism, transferring the sentiment layouts and clues in lower tasks to upper ones. The multiplex strategy enables highly-efficient subtask interflows and avoids repetitive training; meanwhile it sufficiently utilizes the existing data without requiring any further annotation. Further, based on the characteristics of aspect-opinion term extraction and pairing, we enhance our multiplex framework by integrating POS tag and syntactic dependency information for term boundary and pairing identification. The proposed Syntax-aware Multiplex (SyMux) framework enhances the ABSA performances on 28 subtasks (7×4 datasets) with big margins."
12,Logically Consistent Adversarial Attacks for Soft Theorem Provers,Main,"['Text Classification', 'Language Models', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/573,"Recent efforts within the AI community have yielded impressive results towards “soft theorem proving” over natural language sentences using language models. We propose a novel, generative adversarial framework for probing and improving these models’ reasoning capabilities. Adversarial attacks in this domain suffer from the logical inconsistency problem, whereby perturbations to the input may alter the label. Our Logically consistent AdVersarial Attacker, LAVA, addresses this by combining a structured generative process with a symbolic solver, guaranteeing logical consistency. Our framework successfully generates adversarial attacks and identifies global weaknesses common across multiple target models. Our analyses reveal naive heuristics and vulnerabilities in these models’ reasoning capabilities, exposing an incomplete grasp of logical deduction under logic programs. Finally, in addition to effective probing of these models, we show that training on the generated samples improves the target model’s performance."
13,Leveraging the Wikipedia Graph for Evaluating Word Embeddings,Main,"['Embeddings', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/574,"Deep learning models for different NLP tasks often rely on pre-trained word embeddings, that is, vector representations of words. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate pre-trained word embeddings independently of downstream tasks. Such evaluations try to assess whether the geometry induced by a word embedding captures connections made in natural language, such as, analogies, clustering of words, or word similarities. Here, traditionally, similarity is measured by comparison to human judgment. However, explicitly annotating word pairs with similarity scores by surveying humans is expensive. We tackle this problem by formulating a similarity measure that is based on an agent for routing the Wikipedia hyperlink graph. In this graph, word similarities are implicitly encoded by edges between articles. We show on the English Wikipedia that our measure correlates well with a large group of traditional similarity measures, while covering a much larger proportion of words and avoiding explicit human labeling. Moreover, since Wikipedia is available in more than 300 languages, our measure can easily be adapted to other languages, in contrast to traditional similarity measures."
14,Fallacious Argument Classification in Political Debates,Main,"['Text Classification', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/575,"Fallacies play a prominent role in argumentation since antiquity due to their contribution to argumentation in critical thinking education. Their role is even more crucial nowadays as contemporary argumentation technologies face challenging tasks as misleading and manipulative information detection in news articles and political discourse, and counter-narrative generation.  Despite some work in this direction, the issue of classifying arguments as being fallacious largely remains a challenging and an unsolved task. Our contribution is twofold: first, we present a novel annotated resource of 31 political debates from the U.S. Presidential Campaigns, where we annotated six main categories of fallacious arguments (i.e., ad hominem, appeal to authority, appeal to emotion, false cause, slogan, slippery slope) leading to 1628 annotated fallacious arguments; second, we tackle this novel task of fallacious argument classification and we define a neural architecture based on transformers outperforming state-of-the-art results and standard baselines. Our results show the important role played by argument components and relations in this task."
15,Improving Few-Shot Text-to-SQL with Meta Self-Training via Column Specificity,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/576,"The few-shot problem is an urgent challenge for single-table text-to-SQL. Existing methods ignore the potential value of unlabeled data, and merely rely on a coarse-grained Meta-Learning (ML) algorithm that neglects the differences of column contributions to the optimization object. This paper proposes a Meta Self-Training text-to-SQL (MST-SQL) method to solve the problem. Specifically, MST-SQL is based on column-wise HydraNet and adopts self-training as an effective mechanism to learn from readily available unlabeled samples. During each epoch of training, it first predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples and then leverages them to update the parameters. A fine-grained ML algorithm is used in updating, which weighs the contribution of columns by their specificity, in order to further improve the generalizability. Extensive experimental results on both open-domain and domain-specific benchmarks reveal that our MST-SQL has significant advantages in few-shot scenarios,  and is also competitive in standard supervised settings."
16,FastDiff: A Fast Conditional Diffusion Model for High-Quality Speech Synthesis,Main,"['Speech', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/577,"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved leading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative sampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This paper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality speech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer, FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://FastDiff.github.io/."
17,MuiDial: Improving Dialogue Disentanglement with Intent-Based Mutual Learning,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Applications', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/578,"The main goal of dialogue disentanglement is to separate the mixed utterances from a chat slice into independent dialogues. Existing models often utilize either an utterance-to-utterance (U2U) prediction to determine whether two utterances that have the “reply-to” relationship belong to one dialogue, or an utterance-to-thread (U2T) prediction to determine which dialogue-thread a given utterance should belong to. Inspired by mutual leaning, we propose MuiDial, a novel dialogue disentanglement model, to exploit the intent of each utterance and feed the intent to a mutual learning U2U-U2T disentanglement model. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach."
18,AdMix: A Mixed Sample Data Augmentation Method for Neural Machine Translation,Main,['Machine Translation and Multilinguality'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/579,"In Neural Machine Translation (NMT), data augmentation methods such as back-translation have proven their effectiveness in improving translation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach for NMT, which is independent of any additional training data. Our approach, AdMix, consists of two parts: 1) introduce faint discrete noise (word replacement, word dropping, word swapping) into the original sentence pairs to form augmented samples; 2) generate new synthetic training data by softly mixing the augmented samples with their original samples in training corpus. Experiments on three translation datasets of different scales show that AdMix achieves significant improvements (1.0 to 2.7 BLEU points) over strong Transformer baseline. When combined with other data augmentation techniques (e.g., back-translation), our approach can obtain further improvements."
19,Curriculum-Based Self-Training Makes Better Few-Shot Learners for Data-to-Text Generation,Main,"['Language Generation', 'Language Models']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/580,"Despite the success of text-to-text pre-trained models in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks, the generation performance is largely restricted by the number of labeled data in downstream tasks, particularly in data-to-text generation tasks. Existing works mostly utilize abundant unlabeled structured data to conduct unsupervised pre-training for task adaption, which fail to model the complex relationship between source structured data and target texts. Thus, we introduce self-training as a better few-shot learner than task-adaptive pre-training, which explicitly captures this relationship via pseudo-labeled data generated by the pre-trained model. To alleviate the side-effect of low-quality pseudo-labeled data during self-training, we propose a novel method called Curriculum-Based Self-Training (CBST) to effectively leverage unlabeled data in a rearranged order determined by the difficulty of text generation. Experimental results show that our method can outperform fine-tuning and task-adaptive pre-training methods, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot setting of data-to-text generation."
20,Deexaggeration,Main,"['Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/581,"We introduce a new task in hyperbole processing, deexaggeration, which concerns the recovery of the meaning of what is being exaggerated in a hyperbolic sentence in the form of a structured representation. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the computational study of understanding hyperbole by (1) defining a structured representation to encode what is being exaggerated in a hyperbole in a non-hyperbolic manner, (2) annotating the hyperbolic sentences in two existing datasets, HYPO and HYPO-cn, using this structured representation, (3) conducting an empirical analysis of our annotated corpora, and (4) presenting preliminary results on the deexaggeration task."
21,"Taylor, Can You Hear Me Now? A Taylor-Unfolding Framework for Monaural Speech Enhancement",Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/582,"While the deep learning techniques promote the rapid development of the speech enhancement (SE) community, most schemes only pursue the performance in a black-box manner and lack adequate model interpretability. Inspired by Taylor's approximation theory, we propose an interpretable decoupling-style SE framework, which disentangles the complex spectrum recovery into two separate optimization problems i.e., magnitude and complex residual estimation. Specifically, serving as the 0th-order term in Taylor's series, a filter network is delicately devised to suppress the noise component only in the magnitude domain and obtain a coarse spectrum. To refine the phase distribution, we estimate the sparse complex residual, which is defined as the difference between target and coarse spectra, and measures the phase gap. In this study, we formulate the residual component as the combination of various high-order Taylor terms and propose a lightweight trainable module to replace the complicated derivative operator between adjacent terms. Finally, following Taylor's formula, we can reconstruct the target spectrum by the superimposition between 0th-order and high-order terms. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance over previous competing baselines in various evaluation metrics.

22,FastRE: Towards Fast Relation Extraction with Convolutional Encoder and Improved Cascade Binary Tagging Framework,Main,"['Knowledge Extraction', 'Information Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/583,"Recent work for extracting relations from texts has achieved excellent performance. However, most existing methods pay less attention to the efficiency, making it still challenging to quickly extract relations from massive or streaming text data in realistic scenarios. The main efficiency bottleneck is that these methods use a Transformer-based pre-trained language model for encoding, which heavily affects the training speed and inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model (FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging framework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to improve efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE adopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated convolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces the computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the satisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging framework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to accelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then utilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher tagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance, and achieves 3-10$\times$ training speed, 7-15$\times$ inference speed faster, and 1/100 parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is still competitive. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/seukgcode/FastRE}."
23,Neutral Utterances are Also Causes: Enhancing Conversational Causal Emotion Entailment with Social Commonsense Knowledge,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/584,"Conversational Causal Emotion Entailment aims to detect causal utterances for a non-neutral targeted utterance from a conversation. In this work, we build conversations as graphs to overcome implicit contextual modelling of the original entailment style. Following the previous work, we further introduce the emotion information into graphs. Emotion information can markedly promote the detection of causal utterances whose emotion is the same as the targeted utterance. However, it is still hard to detect causal utterances with different emotions, especially neutral ones. The reason is that models are limited in reasoning causal clues and passing them between utterances. To alleviate this problem, we introduce social commonsense knowledge (CSK) and propose a Knowledge Enhanced Conversation graph (KEC). KEC propagates the CSK between two utterances. As not all CSK is emotionally suitable for utterances, we therefore propose a sentiment-realized knowledge selecting strategy to filter CSK. To process KEC, we further construct the Knowledge Enhanced Directed Acyclic Graph networks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines and infers more causes with different emotions from the targeted utterance."
24,Domain-Adaptive Text Classification with Structured Knowledge from Unlabeled Data,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/585,"Domain adaptive text classification is a challenging problem for the large-scale pretrained language models because they often require expensive additional labeled data to adapt to new domains. Existing works usually fails to leverage the implicit relationships among words across domains. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Domain Adaptation with Structured Knowledge (DASK), to enhance domain adaptation by exploiting word-level semantic relationships. DASK first builds a knowledge graph to capture the relationship between pivot terms (domain-independent words) and non-pivot terms in the target domain. Then during training, DASK injects pivot-related knowledge graph information into source domain texts. For the downstream task, these knowledge-injected texts are fed into a BERT variant capable of processing knowledge-injected textual data. Thanks to the knowledge injection, our model learns domain-invariant features for non-pivots according to their relationships with pivots. DASK ensures the pivots to have domain-invariant behaviors by dynamically inferring via the polarity scores of candidate pivots during training with pseudo-labels. We validate DASK on a wide range of cross-domain sentiment classification tasks and observe up to 2.9% absolute performance improvement over baselines for 20 different domain pairs. Code is available at https://github.com/hikaru-nara/DASK."
25,Parameter-Efficient Sparsity for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning,Main,['Language Models'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/586,"With the dramatically increased number of parameters in language models, sparsity methods have received ever-increasing research focus to compress and accelerate the models. While most research focuses on how to accurately retain appropriate weights while maintaining the performance of the compressed model, there are challenges in the computational overhead and memory footprint of sparse training when compressing large-scale language models. To address this problem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to reduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven criteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then we investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and derive two obvious characteristics i.e. low-rankness and structuredness. Based on that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven importance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score matrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and parameter-efficient. Experiments with diverse networks (i.e. BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets demonstrate PST performs on par or better than previous sparsity methods, despite only training a small number of parameters. For instance, compared with previous sparsity methods, our PST only requires 1.5% trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance on BERT."
26,Explicit Alignment Learning for Neural Machine Translation ,Main,"['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/587,"Even though neural machine translation (NMT) has become the state-of-the-art solution for end-to-end translation, it still suffers from a lack of translation interpretability, which may be conveniently enhanced by explicit alignment learning (EAL), as performed in traditional statistical machine translation (SMT). To provide the benefits of both NMT and SMT, this paper presents a novel model design that enhances NMT with an additional training process for EAL, in addition to the end-to-end translation training.  Thus, we propose two approaches an explicit alignment learning approach, in which we further remove the need for the additional alignment model, and perform embedding mixup with the alignment based on encoder--decoder attention weights in the NMT model. We conducted experiments on both small-scale (IWSLT14 De->En and IWSLT13 Fr->En) and large-scale (WMT14 En->De, En->Fr, WMT17 Zh->En) benchmarks. Evaluation results show that our EAL methods significantly outperformed strong baseline methods, which shows the effectiveness of EAL. Further explorations show that the translation improvements are due to a better spatial alignment of the source and target language embeddings. Our method improves translation performance without the need to increase model parameters and training data, which verifies that the idea of incorporating techniques of SMT into NMT is worthwhile."
27,Lyra: A Benchmark for Turducken-Style Code Generation,Main,"['Resources and Evaluation', 'Applications']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/588,"Recently, neural techniques have been used to generate source code automatically. While promising for declarative languages, these approaches achieve much poorer performance on datasets for imperative languages. Since a declarative language is typically embedded in an imperative language (i.e., the turducken-style programming) in real-world software development, the promising results on declarative languages can hardly lead to significant reduction of manual software development efforts. In this paper, we define a new code generation task: given a natural language comment, this task aims to generate a program in a base imperative language with an embedded declarative language. To our knowledge, this is the first turducken-style code generation task. For this task, we present Lyra: a dataset in Python with embedded SQL. This dataset contains 2,000 carefully annotated database manipulation programs from real usage projects. Each program is paired with both a Chinese comment and an English comment. In our experiment, we adopted Transformer, BERT-style, and GPT-style models as baselines. In the best setting, GPT-style model can achieve 24% and 25.5% AST exact matching accuracy using Chinese and English comments, respectively. Therefore, we believe that Lyra provides a new challenge for code generation. Yet, overcoming this challenge may significantly boost the applicability of code generation techniques for real-world software development."
28,CUP: Curriculum Learning based Prompt Tuning for Implicit Event Argument Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Language Models']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/589,"Implicit event argument extraction (EAE) aims to identify arguments that could scatter over the document. Most previous work focuses on learning the direct relations between arguments and the given trigger, while the implicit relations with long-range dependency are not well studied. Moreover, recent neural network based approaches rely on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is unavailable due to the high labelling cost. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum learning based Prompt tuning (CUP) approach, which resolves implicit EAE by four learning stages. The stages are defined according to the relations with the trigger node in a semantic graph, which well captures the long-range dependency between arguments and the trigger. In addition, we integrate a prompt-based encoder-decoder model to elicit related knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs) in each stage, where the prompt templates are adapted with the learning progress to enhance the reasoning for arguments. Experimental results on two well-known benchmark datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we outperform the state-of-the-art models in both fully-supervised and low-data scenarios."
29,Low-Resource NER by Data Augmentation With Prompting,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/590,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental information extraction task that seeks to identify entity mentions of certain types in text. Despite numerous advances, the existing NER methods rely on extensive supervision for model training, which struggle in a low-resource scenario with limited training data. In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation method for low-resource NER, by eliciting knowledge from BERT with prompting strategies. Particularly, we devise a label-conditioned word replacement strategy that can produce more label-consistent examples by capturing the underlying word-label dependencies, and a prompting with question answering method to generate new training data from unlabeled texts.  The experimental results have widely confirmed the effectiveness of our approach. Particularly, in a low-resource scenario with only 150 training sentences, our approach outperforms previous methods without data augmentation by over 40% in F1 and prior best data augmentation methods by over 2.0% in F1. Furthermore, our approach also fits with a zero-shot scenario, yielding promising results without using any human-labeled data for the task."
30,Generating a Structured Summary of Numerous Academic Papers: Dataset and Method,Main,"['Summarization', 'Language Generation', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/591,"Writing a survey paper on one research topic usually needs to cover the salient content from numerous related papers, which can be modeled as a multi-document summarization (MDS) task. Existing MDS datasets usually focus on producing the structureless summary covering a few input documents. Meanwhile, previous structured summary generation works focus on summarizing a single document into a multi-section summary. These existing datasets and methods cannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a structured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose BigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries of numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers’ abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from dozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text sequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and sparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method outperforms various advanced summarization methods."
31,“My nose is running.” “Are you also coughing?”: Building A Medical Diagnosis Agent with Interpretable Inquiry Logics,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Applications']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/592,"With the rise of telemedicine, the task of developing Dialogue Systems for Medical Diagnosis (DSMD) has received much attention in recent years. Different from early researches that needed to rely on extra human resources and expertise to build the system, recent researches focused on how to build DSMD in a data-driven manner. However, the previous data-driven DSMD methods largely overlooked the system interpretability, which is critical for a medical application, and they also suffered from the data sparsity issue at the same time. In this paper, we explore how to bring interpretability to data-driven DSMD. Specifically, we propose a more interpretable decision process to implement the dialogue manager of DSMD by reasonably mimicking real doctors' inquiry logics, and we devise a model with highly transparent components to conduct the inference. Moreover, we collect a new DSMD dataset, which has a much larger scale, more diverse patterns, and is of higher quality than the existing ones. The experiments show that our method obtains 7.7%, 10.0%, 3.0% absolute improvement in diagnosis accuracy respectively on three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of its rational decision process and model design. Our codes and the GMD-12 dataset are available at https://github.com/lwgkzl/BR-Agent."
32,Abstract Rule Learning for Paraphrase Generation,Main,"['Language Generation', 'Summarization']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/593,"In early years, paraphrase generation typically adopts rule-based methods, which are interpretable and able to make global transformations to the original sentence. But they struggle to produce fluent paraphrases. Recently, deep neural networks have shown impressive performances in generating paraphrases. However, the current neural models are black boxes and are prone to make local modifications to the inputs. In this work, we combine these two approaches into RULER, a novel approach that performs abstract rule learning for paraphrasing. The key idea is to explicitly learn generalizable rules that could enhance the paraphrase generation process of neural networks. In RULER, we first propose a rule generalizability metric to guide the model to generate rules underlying the paraphrasing. Then, we leverage neural networks to generate paraphrases by refining the sentences transformed by the learned rules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RULER over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of paraphrase quality, generalization ability and interpretability."
33,Graph-based Dynamic Word Embeddings,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/594,"As time goes by, language evolves with word semantics changing. Unfortunately, traditional word embedding methods neglect the evolution of language and assume that word representations are static. Although contextualized word embedding models can capture the diverse representations of polysemous words, they ignore temporal information as well. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose a graph-based dynamic word embedding (GDWE) model, which focuses on capturing the semantic drift of words continually. We introduce word-level knowledge graphs (WKGs) to store short-term and long-term knowledge. WKGs can provide rich structural information as supplement of lexical information, which help enhance the word embedding quality and capture semantic drift quickly. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our GDWE on dynamic word embedding learning."

The most popular UDA approaches focus on domain-invariant representation learning, trying to align the features from different domains into a similar feature distribution. However, these approaches ignore the direct alignment of input word distributions between domains, which is a vital factor in word-level classification tasks such as cross-domain NER. In this work, we shed new light on cross-domain NER by introducing a subword-level solution, X-Piece, for input word-level distribution shift in NER. Specifically, we re-tokenize the input words of the source domain to approach the target subword distribution, which is formulated and solved as an optimal transport problem. As this approach focuses on the input level, it can also be combined with previous DIRL methods for further improvement. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method based on BERT-tagger on four benchmark NER datasets. Also, the proposed method is proved to benefit DIRL methods such as DANN."
35,Prompting to Distill: Boosting Data-Free Knowledge Distillation via Reinforced Prompt,Main,"['Other', 'Language Models', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/596,"Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) conducts knowledge distillation via eliminating the dependence of original training data, and has recently achieved impressive results in accelerating pre-trained language models.  At the heart of DFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the uncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on hand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction, which can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic distributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained generative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic prompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically relevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the synthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation performance. In some cases, PromptDFD even gives rise to results on par with those from the data-driven knowledge distillation with access to the original training data."
36,Variational Learning for Unsupervised Knowledge Grounded Dialogs,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Language Grounding']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/597,"Recent methods for knowledge grounded dialogs generate responses by incorporating information from an external textual document. These methods do not require the exact document to be known during training and rely on the use of a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from a large index. The documents used to generate the responses are modeled as latent variables whose prior probabilities need to be estimated. Models such as RAG, marginalize the document probabilities over the documents retrieved from the index to define the log-likelihood loss function which is optimized end-to-end.  In this paper, we develop a variational approach to the above technique wherein, we instead maximize the Evidence Lower bound (ELBO). Using a collection of three publicly available open-conversation datasets, we demonstrate how the posterior distribution, which has information from the ground-truth response, allows for a better approximation of the objective function during training.  To overcome the challenges associated with sampling over a large knowledge collection, we develop an efficient approach to approximate the ELBO.  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply variational training for open-scale unsupervised knowledge grounded dialog systems."
37,Enhancing Text Generation via Multi-Level Knowledge Aware Reasoning,Main,"['Applications', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/598,"How to generate high-quality textual content is a non-trivial task. Existing methods generally generate text by grounding on word-level knowledge. However, word-level knowledge cannot express multi-word text units, hence existing methods may generate low-quality and unreasonable text.  In this paper, we leverage event-level knowledge to enhance text generation.  However, event knowledge is very sparse. To solve this problem, we split a coarse-grained event into fine-grained word components to obtain the word-level knowledge among event components. The word-level knowledge models the interaction among event components, which makes it possible to reduce the sparsity of events. Based on the event-level and the word-level knowledge, we devise a multi-level knowledge aware reasoning framework. Specifically, we first utilize event knowledge to make event-based content planning, i.e., select reasonable event sketches conditioned by the input text. Then, we combine the selected event sketches with the word-level knowledge for text generation. We validate our method on two widely used datasets, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework to text generation."
38,Automatic Noisy Label Correction for Fine-Grained Entity Typing,Main,"['Named Entities', 'Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/599,"Fine-grained entity typing (FET) aims to assign proper semantic types to entity mentions according to their context, which is a fundamental task in various entity-leveraging applications. Current FET systems usually establish on large-scale weaklysupervised/distantly annotation data, which may contain abundant noise and thus severely hinder the performance of the FET task. Although previous studies have made great success in automatically identifying the noisy labels in FET, they usually rely on some auxiliary resources which may be unavailable in real-world applications (e.g., pre-defined hierarchical type structures, humanannotated subsets). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically correct noisy labels for FET without external resources. Specifically, it first identifies the potentially noisy labels by estimating the posterior probability of a label being positive or negative according to the logits output by the model, and then relabel candidate noisy labels by training a robust model over the remaining clean labels. Experiments on two popular benchmarks prove the effectiveness of our method. Our source code can be obtained from https://github.com/CCIIPLab/DenoiseFET."

It requires the system to explore the cause of help-seeker's emotional distress and understand their psychological intention to provide supportive responses. However, existing methods mainly focus on the sequential contextual information, ignoring the hierarchical relationships with the global cause and local psychological intention behind conversations, thus leads to a weak ability of emotional support. In this paper, we propose a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network to capture the multi-source information (global cause, local intentions and dialog history) and model hierarchical relationships between them, which consists of a multi-source encoder, a hierarchical graph reasoner, and a global-guide decoder. Furthermore, a novel training objective is designed to monitor semantic information of the global cause. Experimental results on the emotional support conversation dataset, ESConv, confirm that the proposed GLHG has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the automatic and human evaluations."
40,Document-level Relation Extraction via Subgraph Reasoning,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/601,"Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations between entities in a document. In contrast to sentence-level relation extraction, it deals with longer texts and more complex entity interactions, which requires reasoning over multiple sentences with rich reasoning skills. Most current researches construct a document-level graph first, and then focus on the overall graph structure or the paths between the target entity pair in the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel subgraph reasoning (SGR) framework for document-level relation extraction. SGR combines the advantages of both graph-based models and path-based models, integrating various paths between the target entity pair into a much simpler subgraph structure to perform relational reasoning. Moreover, the paths generated by our designed heuristic strategy explicitly model the requisite reasoning skills and roughly cover the supporting sentences for each relation instance. Experimental results on DocRED show that SGR outperforms existing models, and further analyses demonstrate that our method is both effective and explainable.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end model, i.e., Reinforced Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Attention Network (RMHAN), which can learn information at different levels of granularity from tokens and sentences hierarchically. Moreover, with hierarchical reinforcement learning, RMHAN first selects relevant and meaningful tokens, and then selects useful sentences for document-level encoding. Experimental results on DLEF-v2 corpus show that RMHAN model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the best performance."

However, computational resources for these networks are significantly constrained since they usually run on-call on edge devices. In this paper, we present BiFSMN, an accurate and extreme-efficient binary neural network for KWS. We first construct a High-frequency Enhancement Distillation scheme for the binarization-aware training, which emphasizes the high-frequency information from the full-precision network's representation that is more crucial for the optimization of the binarized network. Then, to allow the instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime, we also propose a Thinnable Binarization Architecture to further liberate the acceleration potential of the binarized network from the topology perspective. Moreover, we implement a Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel for BiFSMN on ARMv8 devices which fully utilizes registers and increases instruction throughput to push the limit of deployment efficiency. Extensive experiments show that BiFSMN outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins on various datasets and is even comparable with the full-precision counterpart (e.g., less than 3% drop on Speech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the thinnable architecture and the optimized 1-bit implementation, BiFSMN can achieve an impressive 22.3x speedup and 15.5x storage-saving on real-world edge hardware."

State-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic parsers are seq2seq architectures based on large language models that have been pretrained on vast amounts of text. To better leverage that pretraining, recent work has explored a reformulation of semantic parsing whereby the output sequences are themselves natural language sentences, but in a controlled fragment of natural language. This approach delivers strong results, particularly for few-shot semantic parsing, which is of key importance in practice and the focus of our paper. We push this line of work forward by introducing an automated methodology that delivers very significant additional improvements by utilizing modest amounts of unannotated data, which is typically easy to obtain. Our method is based on a novel synthesis of four techniques: joint training with auxiliary unsupervised tasks; constrained decoding; self-training; and paraphrasing. We show that this method delivers new SOTA few-shot performance on the Overnight dataset, particularly in very low-resource settings, and very compelling few-shot results on a new semantic parsing dataset."
44,Relational Triple Extraction: One Step is Enough,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/605,"Extracting relational triples from unstructured text is an essential task in natural language processing and knowledge graph construction. Existing approaches usually contain two fundamental steps: (1) finding the boundary positions of head and tail entities; (2) concatenating specific tokens to form triples. However, nearly all previous methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation, i.e., the boundary recognition error of each entity in step (1) will be accumulated into the final combined triples. To solve the problem, in this paper, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the triple extraction task and propose a simple but effective model, named DirectRel.  Specifically, the proposed model first generates candidate entities through enumerating token sequences in a sentence, and then transforms the triple extraction task into a linking problem on a ``head -> tail"" bipartite graph. By doing so, all triples can be directly extracted in only one step. Extensive experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines."

In this paper, we propose a generic and language-independent strategy for multilingual GEC, which can train a GEC system effectively for a new non-English language with only two easy-to-access resources: 1) a pre-trained cross-lingual language model (PXLM) and 2) parallel translation data between English and the language.  Our approach creates diverse parallel GEC data without any language-specific operations by taking the non-autoregressive translation generated by PXLM and the gold translation as error-corrected sentence pairs. Then, we reuse PXLM to initialize the GEC model and pre-train it with the synthetic data generated by itself, which yields further improvement. We evaluate our approach on three public benchmarks of GEC in different languages. It achieves the state-of-the-art results on the NLPCC 2018 Task 2 dataset (Chinese) and obtains competitive performance on Falko-Merlin (German) and RULEC-GEC (Russian). Further analysis demonstrates that our data construction method is complementary to rule-based approaches."
46,On Tracking Dialogue State by Inheriting Slot Values in Mentioned Slot Pools,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/607,"Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a component of the task oriented dialogue system. It is responsible for extracting and managing slots, where each slot represents a part of the information to accomplish a task, and slot value is updated recurrently in each dialogue turn. However, many DST models cannot update slot values appropriately. These models may repeatedly inherit wrong slot values extracted in previous turns, resulting in the fail of the entire DST task. They cannot update indirectly mentioned slots well, either. This study designed a model with a mentioned slot pool (MSP) to tackle the update problem. The MSP is a slot specific memory that records all mentioned slot values that may be inherited, and our model updates slot values according to the MSP and the dialogue context. Our model rejects inheriting the previous slot value when it predicates the value is wrong. Then, it extracts the slot value from the current dialogue context. As the contextual information accumulates, the new value is more likely to be correct. It also can track the indirectly mentioned slot by picking a value from the MSP. Experimental results showed our model reached state of the art DST performance on MultiWOZ datasets."

Nevertheless, discourse information that has been proven effective in many NLP tasks is ignored in most previous work. In this work, we aim at incorporating the coherence information hidden within the RST-style discourse structure into machine translation. To achieve it, we propose a document-level NMT system enhanced with the discourse-aware document context, which is named Disco2NMT. Specifically, Disco2NMT models document context based on the discourse dependency structures through a hierarchical architecture. We first convert the RST tree of an article into a dependency structure and then build the graph convolutional network (GCN) upon the segmented EDUs under the guidance of RST dependencies to capture the discourse-aware context for NMT incorporation. We conduct experiments on the document-level English-German and English-Chinese translation tasks with three domains (TED, News, and Europarl). Experimental results show that our Disco2NMT model significantly surpasses both context-agnostic and context-aware baseline systems on multiple evaluation indicators."

Conventional efforts often focus on balancing the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability, for instance, sacrificing model performance to increase the explainability. Here, we take a unique approach and show that model interpretation can ultimately help improve NLP quality. Specifically, we employ our learned interpretability results using attention mechanisms, LIME, and SHAP to train our model. We demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy of up to +3.4  BLEU points on NMT and up to +4.8 points on GLUE tasks, verifying our hypothesis that it is possible to achieve better model learning by incorporating model interpretation knowledge."
49,Robust Fine-tuning via Perturbation and Interpolation from In-batch Instances,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/610,"Fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks has become common practice in natural language processing. However, most of the PLMs are vulnerable, e.g., they are brittle under adversarial attacks or imbalanced data, which hinders the application of the PLMs on some downstream tasks, especially in safe-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method called Match-Tuning to force the PLMs to be more robust. For each instance in a batch, we involve other instances in the same batch to interact with it. To be specific, regarding the instances with other labels as a perturbation, Match-Tuning makes the model more robust to noise at the beginning of training. While nearing the end, Match-Tuning focuses more on performing an interpolation among the instances with the same label for better generalization. Extensive experiments on various tasks in GLUE benchmark show that Match-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning by 1.64 scores. Moreover, Match-Tuning exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and data imbalance."

Recent works propose to learn entity representations based on entity-centric contexts, which achieve SOTA performances on many tasks. However, these methods lead to poor representations for unseen entities since they rely on a multitude of occurrences for each entity to enable accurate representations. To address this issue, we propose to learn enhanced descriptional representations for unseen entities by distilling knowledge from distributional semantics into descriptional embeddings. Specifically, we infer enhanced embeddings for unseen entities based on descriptions by aligning the descriptional embedding space to the distributional embedding space with different granularities, i.e., element-level, batch-level and space-level alignment. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our approach improves the performance over all baseline methods. In particular, our approach can achieve the effectiveness of the teacher model on almost all entities, and maintain such high performance on unseen entities."

In this work, we present a simple but effective monolingual pretraining task called contrastive context prediction (CCP) to learn sentence representation by modeling sentence level contextual relation. By pushing the embedding of sentences in a local context closer and pushing random negative samples away, different languages could form isomorphic structure, then sentence pairs in two different languages will be automatically aligned.  Our experiments show that model collapse and information leakage are very easy to happen during contrastive training of language model, but language-specific memory bank and asymmetric batch normalization operation play an essential role in preventing collapsing and information leakage, respectively. Besides, a post-processing for sentence embedding is also very effective to achieve better retrieval performance.  On the multilingual sentence retrieval task Tatoeba, our model achieves new SOTA results among methods without using bilingual data. Our model also shows larger gain on Tatoeba when transferring between non-English pairs. On two multi-lingual query-passage retrieval tasks, XOR Retrieve and Mr.TYDI, our model even achieves two SOTA results in both zero-shot and supervised setting among all pretraining models using bilingual data."

Various span-based methods have been proposed to detect nested entities with span representations. However, span-based methods do not consider the relationship between a span and other entities or phrases, which is helpful in the NER task. Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting long entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues, we present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction network for nested NER. In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation. Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat NER dataset."

However, we discover that existing syntax-based models suffer from two issues: noisy information aggregation and loss of distant correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed Neural Subgraph Explorer, which  (1) reduces the noisy information via pruning target-irrelevant nodes on the syntax graph; (2) introduces beneficial first-order connections between the target and its related words into the obtained graph. Specifically, we design a multi-hop actions score estimator to evaluate the value of each word regarding the specific target. The discrete action sequence is sampled through Gumble-Softmax and then used for both of the syntax graph and the self-attention graph. To introduce the first-order connections between the target and its relevant words, the two pruned graphs are merged. Finally, graph convolution is conducted on the obtained unified graph to update the hidden states. And this process is stacked with multiple layers. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of target-oriented syntax graph pruning in this task. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance."

The taxonomy expansion task aims to incorporate emergent concepts into the existing taxonomies. Prior works focus on modeling the local substructure of taxonomies but neglect the global structure. In this paper, we propose TaxoPrompt, a framework that learns the global structure by prompt tuning with taxonomic context. Prompt tuning leverages a template to formulate downstream tasks into masked language model form for better distributed semantic knowledge use. To further infuse global structure knowledge into language models, we enhance the prompt template by exploiting the taxonomic context constructed by a variant of the random walk algorithm. Experiments on seven public benchmarks show that our proposed TaxoPrompt is effective and efficient in automatically expanding taxonomies and achieves state-of-the-art performance."
55,Robust Interpretable Text Classification against Spurious Correlations Using AND-rules with Negation,Main,"['Text Classification', 'Applications', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/616,"The state-of-the-art natural language processing models have raised the bar for excellent performance on a variety of tasks in recent years. However, concerns are rising over their primitive sensitivity to distribution biases that reside in the training and testing data. This issue hugely impacts the performance of the models when exposed to out-of-distribution and counterfactual data. The root cause seems to be that many machine learning models are prone to learn the shortcuts, modelling simple correlations rather than more fundamental and general relationships. As a result, such text classifiers tend to perform poorly when a human makes minor modifications to the data, which raises questions regarding their robustness. In this paper, we employ a rule-based architecture called Tsetlin Machine (TM) that learns both simple and complex correlations by ANDing features and their negations. As such, it generates explainable AND-rules using negated and non-negated reasoning. Here, we explore how non-negated reasoning can be more prone to distribution biases than negated reasoning. We further leverage this finding by adapting the TM architecture to mainly perform negated reasoning using the specificity parameter s. As a result, the AND-rules becomes robust to spurious correlations and can also correctly predict counterfactual data. Our empirical investigation of the model's robustness uses the specificity s to control the degree of negated reasoning. Experiments on publicly available Counterfactually-Augmented Data demonstrate that the negated clauses are robust to spurious correlations and outperform Naive Bayes, SVM, and Bi-LSTM by up to 20 %, and  ELMo by almost 6 % on counterfactual test data."
56,Diversity Features Enhanced Prototypical Network for Few-shot Intent Detection,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Applications', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/617,"Few-shot Intent Detection (FSID) is a challenging task in dialogue systems due to the scarcity of available annotated utterances. Although existing few-shot learning approaches have made remarkable progress, they fall short in adapting to the Generalized Few-shot Intent Detection (GFSID) task where both seen and unseen classes are present. A core problem of the simultaneous existence of these two tasks is that limited training samples fail to cover the diversity of user expressions. In this paper, we propose an effective Diversity Features Enhanced Prototypical Network (DFEPN) to enhance diversity features for novel intents by fully exploiting the diversity of known intent samples. Specially, DFEPN generates diversity features of samples in the hidden space via a diversity feature generator module and then fuses these features with original support vectors to get a more suitable prototype vector of each class. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model on both FSID and GFSID tasks, we carry out sufficient experiments on two benchmark intent detection datasets. Results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and keeps stable performance on both two tasks."
57,UM4: Unified Multilingual Multiple Teacher-Student Model for Zero-Resource Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/618,"Most translation tasks among languages belong to the zero-resource translation problem where parallel corpora are unavailable. Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables one-pass translation using shared semantic space for all languages compared to the two-pass pivot translation but often underperforms the pivot-based method. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named as Unified Multilingual Multiple teacher-student Model for NMT (UM4). Our method unifies source-teacher, target-teacher, and pivot-teacher models to guide the student model for the zero-resource translation. The source teacher and target teacher force the student to learn the direct source-target translation by the distilled knowledge on both source and target sides. The monolingual corpus is further leveraged by the pivot-teacher model to enhance the student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model of 72 directions significantly outperforms previous methods on the WMT benchmark."
58,High-resource Language-specific Training for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,Main,"['Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/619,"Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) trained in multiple language pairs has attracted considerable attention due to fewer model parameters and lower training costs by sharing knowledge among multiple languages. Nonetheless, multilingual training is plagued by language interference degeneration in shared parameters because of the negative interference among different translation directions, especially on high-resource languages. In this paper, we propose the multilingual translation model with the high-resource language-specific training (HLT-MT) to alleviate the negative interference, which adopts the two-stage training with the language-specific selection mechanism. Specifically, we first train the multilingual model only with the high-resource pairs and select the language-specific modules at the top of the decoder to enhance the translation quality of high-resource directions. Next, the model is further trained on all available corpora to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages (HRLs) to low-resource languages (LRLs). Experimental results show that HLT-MT outperforms various strong baselines on WMT-10 and OPUS-100 benchmarks. Furthermore, the analytic experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the negative interference in multilingual training."
59,SyntaSpeech: Syntax-Aware Generative Adversarial Text-to-Speech,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/620,"The recent progress in non-autoregressive text-to-speech (NAR-TTS) has made fast and high-quality speech synthesis possible. However, current NAR-TTS models usually use phoneme sequence as input and thus cannot understand the tree-structured syntactic information of the input sequence, which hurts the prosody modeling. To this end, we propose SyntaSpeech, a syntax-aware and light-weight NAR-TTS model, which integrates tree-structured syntactic information into the prosody modeling modules in PortaSpeech. Specifically, 1) We build a syntactic graph based on the dependency tree of the input sentence, then process the text encoding with a syntactic graph encoder to extract the syntactic information. 2) We incorporate the extracted syntactic encoding with PortaSpeech to improve the prosody prediction. 3) We introduce a multi-length discriminator to replace the flow-based post-net in PortaSpeech, which simplifies the training pipeline and improves the inference speed, while keeping the naturalness of the generated audio. Experiments on three datasets not only show that the tree-structured syntactic information grants SyntaSpeech the ability to synthesize better audio with expressive prosody, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of SyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech. Ablation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in SyntaSpeech.  Source code and audio samples are available at https://syntaspeech.github.io."
60,Clickbait Detection via Contrastive Variational Modelling of Text and Label,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/621,"Clickbait refers to deliberately created sensational or deceptive text for tricking readers into clicking, which severely hurts the web ecosystem. With a growing number of clickbaits on social media, developing automatic detection methods becomes essential. Nonetheless, the performance of existing neural classifiers is limited due to the underutilization of small labelled datasets. Inspired by related pedagogy theories that learning to write can promote comprehension ability, we propose a novel Contrastive Variational Modelling (CVM) framework to exploit the labelled data better. CVM models the conditional distributions of text and clickbait labels by predicting labels from text and generating text from labels simultaneously with Variational AutoEncoder and further differentiates the learned spaces under each label by a mixed contrastive learning loss. In this way, CVM can capture more underlying textual properties and hence utilize label information to its full potential, boosting detection performance. We theoretically demonstrate CVM as learning a joint distribution of text, clickbait label, and latent variable. Experiments on three clickbait detection datasets show our method's robustness to inadequate and biased labels, outperforming several recent strong baselines."
61,Targeted Multimodal Sentiment Classification based on Coarse-to-Fine Grained Image-Target Matching,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/622,"Targeted Multimodal Sentiment Classification (TMSC) aims to identify the sentiment polarities over each target mentioned in a pair of sentence and image. Existing methods to TMSC failed to explicitly capture both coarse-grained and fine-grained image-target matching, including 1) the relevance between the image and the target and 2) the alignment between visual objects and the target. To tackle this issue, we propose a new multi-task learning architecture named coarse-to-fine grained Image-Target Matching network (ITM), which jointly performs image-target relevance classification, object-target alignment, and targeted sentiment classification. We further construct an Image-Target Matching dataset by manually annotating the image-target relevance and the visual object aligned with the input target. Experiments on two benchmark TMSC datasets show that our model consistently outperforms the baselines, achieves state-of-the-art results, and presents interpretable visualizations."
62,Stage-wise Stylistic Headline Generation: Style Generation and Summarized Content Insertion,Main,"['Language Generation', 'Applications', 'Summarization']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/623,"A quality headline with a high click-rate should not only summarize the content of an article, but also reflect a style that attracts users. Such demand has drawn rising attention to the task of stylistic headline generation (SHG). An intuitive method is to first generate plain headlines leveraged by document-headline parallel data then transfer them to a target style. However, this inevitably suffers from error propagation. Therefore, to unify the two sub-tasks and explicitly decompose style-relevant attributes and summarize content, we propose an end-to-end stage-wise SHG model containing the style generation component and the content insertion component, where the former generates stylistic-relevant intermediate outputs and the latter receives these outputs then inserts the summarized content. The intermediate outputs are observable, making the style generation easy to control. Our system is comprehensively evaluated by both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and it achieves state-of-the-art results in SHG over three different stylistic datasets."
63,Position-aware Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with Attention Mechanism,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Language Models', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/624,"Named entity recognition and relation extraction are two important core subtasks of information extraction, which aim to identify named entities and extract relations between them. In recent years, span representation methods have received a lot of attention and are widely used to extract entities and corresponding relations from plain texts. Most recent works focus on how to obtain better span representations from pre-trained encoders, but ignore the negative impact of a large number of span candidates on slowing down the model performance. In our work, we propose a joint entity and relation extraction model with an attention mechanism and position-attentive markers. The attention score of each candidate span is calculated, and most of the candidate spans with low attention scores are pruned before being fed into the span classifier, thus achieving the goal of removing the most irrelevant spans. At the same time, in order to explore whether the position information can improve the performance of the model, we add position-attentive markers to the model. The experimental results show that our model is effective. With the same pre-trained encoder, our model achieves the new state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks (ACE05, CoNLL04 and SciERC), obtaining a 4.7%-17.8% absolute improvement in relation F1."
64,EditSinger: Zero-Shot Text-Based Singing Voice Editing System with Diverse Prosody Modeling,Main,"['Speech', 'Applications']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/625,"Zero-shot text-based singing editing enables singing voice modification based on the given edited lyrics without any additional data from the target singer. However, due to the different demands, challenges occur when applying existing speech editing methods to singing voice editing task, mainly including the lack of systematic consideration concerning prosody in insertion and deletion, as well as the trade-off between the naturalness of pronunciation and the preservation of prosody in replacement. In this paper we propose EditSinger, which is a novel singing voice editing model with specially designed diverse prosody modules to overcome the challenges above. Specifically, 1) a general masked variance adaptor is introduced for the comprehensive prosody modeling of the inserted lyrics and the transition of deletion boundary; and 2) we further design a fusion pitch predictor for replacement. By disentangling the reference pitch and fusing the predicted pronunciation, the edited pitch can be reconstructed, which could ensure a natural pronunciation while preserving the prosody of the original audio. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first zero-shot text-based singing voice editing system. Our experiments conducted on the OpenSinger prove that EditSinger can synthesize high-quality edited singing voices with natural prosody according to the corresponding operations."
65,“Think Before You Speak”: Improving Multi-Action Dialog Policy by Planning Single-Action Dialogs,Main,"['Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Applications']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/626,"Multi-action dialog policy (MADP), which generates multiple atomic dialog actions per turn, has been widely applied in task-oriented dialog systems to provide expressive and efficient system responses. Existing MADP models usually imitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog samples. Due to data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While interactive learning and reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied to incorporate external data sources of real users and user simulators, they take significant manual effort to build and suffer from instability. To address these issues, we propose Planning Enhanced Dialog Policy (PEDP), a novel multi-task learning framework that learns single-action dialog dynamics to enhance multi-action prediction. Our PEDP method employs model-based planning for conceiving what to express before deciding the current response through simulating single-action dialogs. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that our fully supervised learning-based method achieves a solid task success rate of 90.6%, improving 3% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and the appendix of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/ShuoZhangXJTU/PEDP."
66,Charge Prediction by Constitutive Elements Matching of Crimes,Main,"['Applications', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/627,"Charge prediction is to automatically predict the judgemental charges for legal cases. To convict a person/unit of a charge, the case description must contain matching instances of the constitutive elements (CEs) of that charge. This knowledge of CEs is a valuable guide for the judge in making final decisions. However, it is far from fully exploited for charge prediction in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel method named Constitutive Elements-guided Charge Prediction (CECP). CECP mimics human's charge identification process to extract potential instances of CEs and generate predictions accordingly. It avoids laborious labeling of matching instances of CEs by a novel reinforcement learning module which progressively selects potentially matching sentences for CEs and evaluates their relevance. The final prediction is generated based on the selected sentences and their relevant CEs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of CECP over competitive baselines."
67,CauAIN: Causal Aware Interaction Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversations,Main,"['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Dialogue and Interactive Systems', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/628,"Emotion Recognition in Conversations has attained increasing interest in the natural language processing community. Many neural-network based approaches endeavor to solve the challenge of emotional dynamics in conversations and gain appealing results. However, these works are limited in capturing deep emotional clues in conversational context because they ignore the emotion cause that could be viewed as stimulus to the target emotion. In this work, we propose Causal Aware Interaction Network (CauAIN) to thoroughly understand the conversational context with the help of emotion cause detection. Specifically, we retrieve causal clues provided by commonsense knowledge to guide the process of causal utterance traceback. Both retrieve and traceback steps are performed from the perspective of intra- and inter-speaker interaction simultaneously. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better performance over most baseline models."
68,Reasoning over Hybrid Chain for Table-and-Text Open Domain Question Answering ,Main,"['Question Answering', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining', 'Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/629,"Tabular and textual question answering requires systems to perform reasoning over heterogeneous information, considering table structure, and the connections among table and text. In this paper, we propose a ChAin-centric Reasoning and Pre-training framework (CARP). CARP utilizes hybrid chain to model the explicit intermediate reasoning process across table and text for question answering. We also propose a novel chain-centric pre-training method, to enhance the pre-trained model in identifying the cross-modality reasoning process and alleviating the data sparsity problem. This method constructs the large-scale reasoning corpus by synthesizing pseudo heterogeneous reasoning paths from Wikipedia and generating corresponding questions. We evaluate our system on OTT-QA, a large-scale table-and-text open-domain question answering benchmark, and our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Further analyses illustrate that the explicit hybrid chain offers substantial performance improvement and interpretablity of the intermediate reasoning process, and the chain-centric pre-training boosts the performance on the chain extraction."
69,None Class Ranking Loss for Document-Level Relation Extraction,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/630,"Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims at extracting relations among entities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a multi-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do not express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as ""none"" or ""no relation"". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish such none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes (relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of pre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of ""no relation"". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that encourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and works well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none class instances are available for training."
70,Grape: Grammar-Preserving Rule Embedding,Main,"['Applications', 'Language Generation', 'Natural Language Semantics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/631,"Word embedding has been widely used in various areas to boost the performance of the neural models. However, when processing context-free languages, embedding grammar rules with word embedding loses two types of information. One is the structural relationship between the grammar rules, and the other one is the content information of the rule definition. In this paper, we make the first attempt to learn a grammar-preserving rule embedding. We first introduce a novel graph structure to represent the context-free grammar. Then, we apply a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract the structural information and use a gating layer to integrate content information.  We conducted experiments on six widely-used benchmarks containing four context-free languages. The results show that our approach improves the accuracy of the base model by 0.8 to 6.4 percentage points. Furthermore, Grape also achieves 1.6 F1 score improvement on the method naming task which shows the generality of our approach."

In contrast to the previous studies, we propose a fast and lightweight model named as PTPCG. In our model, we design a novel strategy for event argument combination together with a non-autoregressive decoding algorithm via pruned complete graphs, which are constructed under the guidance of the automatically selected pseudo triggers. Compared to the previous systems, our system achieves competitive results with 19.8% of parameters and much lower resource consumption, taking only 3.8% GPU hours for training and up to 8.5 times faster for inference. Besides, our model shows superior compatibility for the datasets with (or without) triggers and the pseudo triggers can be the supplements for annotated triggers to make further improvements.

72,Contrastive Graph Transformer Network for Personality Detection,Main,"['Psycholinguistics', 'Applications', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/633,"Personality detection is to identify the personality traits underlying social media posts. Most of the existing work is mainly devoted to learning the representations of posts based on labeled data. Yet the ground-truth personality traits are collected through time-consuming questionnaires. Thus, one of the biggest limitations lies in the lack of training data for this data-hungry task. In addition, the correlations among traits should be considered since they are important psychological cues that could help collectively identify the traits. In this paper, we construct a fully-connected post graph for each user and develop a novel Contrastive Graph Transformer Network model (CGTN) which distills potential labels of the graphs based on both labeled and unlabeled data. Specifically, our model first explores a self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the post embeddings. We design two types of post graph augmentations to incorporate different priors based on psycholinguistic knowledge of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and post semantics. Then, upon the post embeddings of the graph, a Transformer-based decoder equipped with post-to-trait attention is exploited to generate traits sequentially. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that our CGTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for personality detection."
