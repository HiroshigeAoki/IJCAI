0,Bias Silhouette Analysis: Towards Assessing the Quality of Bias Metrics for Word Embedding Models,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/77,"Word embedding models reflect bias towards genders, ethnicities, and other social groups present in the underlying training data. Metrics such as ECT, RNSB, and WEAT quantify bias in these models based on predefined word lists representing social groups and bias-conveying concepts. How suitable these lists actually are to reveal bias - let alone the bias metrics in general - remains unclear, though. In this paper, we study how to assess the quality of bias metrics for word embedding models. In particular, we present a generic method, Bias Silhouette Analysis (BSA), that quantifies the accuracy and robustness of such a metric and of the word lists used. Given a biased and an unbiased reference embedding model, BSA applies the metric systematically for several subsets of the lists to the models. The variance and rate of convergence of the bias values of each model then entail the robustness of the word lists, whereas the distance between the models' values gives indications of the general accuracy of the metric with the word lists. We demonstrate the behavior of BSA on two standard embedding models for the three mentioned metrics with several word lists from existing research."
1,Phonovisual Biases in Language: is the Lexicon Tied to the Visual World?,Main,"['Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation', 'Psycholinguistics']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/89,"The present paper addresses the study of cross-linguistic and cross-modal iconicity within a deep learning framework. An LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network is trained to associate the phonetic representation of a concrete word, encoded as a sequence of feature vectors, to the visual representation of its referent, expressed as an HCNN-transformed image. The processing network is then tested, without further training, in a language that does not appear in the training set and belongs to a different language family. The performance of the model is evaluated through a comparison with a randomized baseline; we show that such an imaginative network is capable of extracting language-independent generalizations in the mapping from linguistic sounds to visual features, providing empirical support for the hypothesis of a universal sound-symbolic substrate underlying all languages."
2,TCIC: Theme Concepts Learning Cross Language and Vision for Image Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/91,"Existing research for image captioning usually represents an image using a scene graph with low-level facts (objects and relations) and fails to capture the high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a Theme Concepts extended Image Captioning (TCIC) framework that incorporates theme concepts to represent high-level cross-modality semantics. In practice, we model theme concepts as memory vectors and propose Transformer with Theme Nodes (TTN) to incorporate those vectors for image captioning. Considering that theme concepts can be learned from both images and captions, we propose two settings for their representations learning based on TTN. On the vision side, TTN is configured to take both scene graph based features and theme concepts as input for visual representation learning. On the language side, TTN is configured to take both captions and theme concepts as input for text representation re-construction. Both settings aim to generate target captions with the same transformer-based decoder. During the training, we further align representations of theme concepts learned from images and corresponding captions to enforce the cross-modality learning. Experimental results on MS COCO show the effectiveness of our approach compared to some state-of-the-art models."
3,Speech2Talking-Face: Inferring and Driving a Face with Synchronized Audio-Visual Representation,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/141,"What can we picture solely from a clip of speech? Previous research has shown the possibility of directly inferring the appearance of a person's face by listening to a voice. However, within human speech lies not only the biometric identity signal but also the identity-irrelevant information such as the talking content. Our goal is to extract as much information from a clip of speech as possible. In particular, we aim at not only inferring the face of a person but also animating it. Our key insight is to synchronize audio and visual representations from two perspectives in a style-based generative framework. Specifically, contrastive learning is leveraged to map both the identity and speech content information within the speech to visual representation spaces. Furthermore, the identity space is strengthened with class centroids. Through curriculum learning, the style-based generator is capable of automatically balancing the information from the two latent spaces. Extensive experiments show that our approach encourages better speech-identity correlation learning while generating vivid faces whose identities are consistent with given speech samples. Moreover, by leveraging the same model, these inferred faces can be driven to talk by the audio."
4,MatchVIE: Exploiting  Match Relevancy between Entities  for Visual Information Extraction,Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/144,"Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout. But simply introducing multimodal features can't work well when faced with numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities. Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the existing methods."
5,"Tag, Copy or Predict: A Unified Weakly-Supervised Learning Framework for Visual Information Extraction using Sequences",Main,['Information Extraction'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/150,"Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character recognition (OCR) results in plain texts and then utilized token-level category annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, the OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper, we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPNet (Tag, Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results, 2) a weakly-supervised training method that utilizes only sequence-level supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves its effectiveness."
6,An Entanglement-driven Fusion Neural Network for Video Sentiment Analysis,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/239,"Video data is multimodal in its nature, where an utterance can involve linguistic, visual and acoustic information. Therefore, a key challenge for video sentiment analysis is how to combine different modalities for sentiment recognition effectively. The latest neural network approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance, but they neglect to a large degree of how humans understand and reason about sentiment states. By contrast, recent advances in quantum probabilistic neural models have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, yet with better transparency and increased level of interpretability. However, the existing quantum-inspired models treat quantum states as either a classical mixture or as a separable tensor product across modalities, without triggering their interactions in a way that they are correlated or non-separable (i.e., entangled). This means that the current models have not fully exploited the expressive power of quantum probabilities. To fill this gap, we propose a transparent quantum probabilistic neural model. The model induces different modalities to interact in such a way that they may not be separable, encoding crossmodal information in the form of non-classical correlations. Comprehensive evaluation on two benchmarking datasets for video sentiment analysis shows that the model achieves significant performance improvement. We also show that the degree of non-separability between modalities optimizes the post-hoc interpretability."
7,HIP Network: Historical Information Passing Network for Extrapolation Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graph,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/264,"In recent years, temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has received significant attention. Most existing methods assume that all timestamps and corresponding graphs are available during training, which makes it difficult to predict future events. To address this issue, recent works learn to infer future events based on historical information. However, these methods do not comprehensively consider the latent patterns behind temporal changes, to pass historical information selectively, update representations appropriately and predict events accurately. In this paper, we propose the Historical Information Passing (HIP) network to predict future events. HIP network passes information from temporal, structural and repetitive perspectives, which are used to model the temporal evolution of events, the interactions of events at the same time step, and the known events respectively. In particular, our method considers the updating of relation representations and adopts three scoring functions corresponding to the above dimensions. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show the superiority of HIP network, and the significant improvements on Hits@1 prove that our method can more accurately predict what is going to happen."
8,Dependent Multi-Task Learning with Causal Intervention for Image Captioning,Main,['Natural Language Generation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/312,"Recent work for image captioning mainly followed an extract-then-generate paradigm, pre-extracting a sequence of object-based features and then formulating image captioning as a single sequence-to-sequence task. Although promising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content inconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not informative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From a causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious statistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g., visual features of ""long hair"" and ""woman""). In this paper, we propose a dependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI). Firstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before the final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model better understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content inconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model, cutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and thus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the high-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the real confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enable end-to-end training and reduce the inter-task error accumulations. The extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the baseline models and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models."
9,On Guaranteed Optimal Robust Explanations for NLP Models,Main,['Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/366,"We build on abduction-based explanations for machine learning and develop a method for computing local explanations for neural network models in natural language processing (NLP). Our explanations comprise a subset of the words of the input text that satisfies two key features: optimality w.r.t. a user-defined cost function, such as the length of explanation, and robustness, in that they ensure prediction invariance for any bounded perturbation in the embedding space of the left-out words. We present two solution algorithms, respectively based on implicit hitting sets and maximum universal subsets, introducing a number of algorithmic improvements to speed up convergence of hard instances. We show how our method can be configured with different perturbation sets in the embedded space and used to detect bias in predictions by enforcing include/exclude constraints on biased terms, as well as to enhance existing heuristic-based NLP explanation frameworks such as Anchors. We evaluate our framework on three widely used sentiment analysis tasks and texts of up to 100 words from SST, Twitter and IMDB datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the derived explanations."
10,Learning Embeddings from Knowledge Graphs With Numeric Edge Attributes,Main,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/395,"Numeric values associated to edges of a knowledge graph have been used to represent uncertainty, edge importance, and even out-of-band knowledge in a growing number of scenarios, ranging from genetic data to social networks. Nevertheless, traditional knowledge graph embedding models are not designed to capture such information, to the detriment of predictive power.  We propose a novel method that injects numeric edge attributes into the scoring layer of a traditional knowledge graph embedding architecture. Experiments with publicly available numeric-enriched knowledge graphs show that our method outperforms traditional numeric-unaware baselines as well as the recent UKGE model."
11,Progressive Open-Domain Response Generation with Multiple Controllable Attributes,Main,['Dialogue'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/451,"It is desirable to include more controllable attributes to enhance the diversity of generated responses in open-domain dialogue systems.  However, existing methods can generate responses with only one controllable attribute or lack a flexible way to generate them with multiple controllable attributes.  In this paper, we propose a Progressively trained Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (PHED) to tackle this task.  More specifically, PHED deploys Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) on Transformer to include one aspect of attributes at one stage.  A vital characteristic of the CVAE is to separate the latent variables at each stage into two types: a global variable capturing the common semantic features and a specific variable absorbing the attribute information at that stage.  PHED then couples the CVAE latent variables with the Transformer encoder and is trained by minimizing a newly derived ELBO and controlled losses to produce the next stage's input and produce responses as required.  Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations to show that PHED significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generation models and produces more diverse responses as expected."
12,BESA: BERT-based Simulated Annealing for Adversarial Text Attacks,Main,['Natural Language Processing'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/453,"Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are known immensely brittle towards text adversarial examples. Recent attack algorithms usually adopt word-level substitution strategies following a pre-computed word replacement mechanism. However, their resultant adversarial examples are still imperfect in achieving grammar correctness and semantic similarities, which is largely because of their unsuitable candidate word selections and static optimization methods. In this research, we propose BESA, a BERT-based Simulated Annealing algorithm,  to address these two problems. Firstly, we leverage the BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) to generate contextual-aware candidate words to produce fluent adversarial text and avoid grammar errors. Secondly, we employ Simulated Annealing (SA) to adaptively determine the word substitution order. The SA provides sufficient word replacement options via internal simulations, with an objective to obtain both a high attack success rate and a low word substitution rate.  Besides, our algorithm is able to jump out of local optima with a controlled probability, making it closer to achieve the best possible attack (i.e., the global optima). Experiments on five popular datasets manifest the superiority of BESA compared with existing methods, including TextFooler, BAE, BERT-Attack, PWWS, and PSO."
13,Correlation-Guided Representation for Multi-Label Text Classification,Main,['Text Classification'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/463,"Multi-label text classification is an essential task in natural language processing. Existing multi-label classification models generally consider labels as categorical variables and ignore the exploitation of label semantics. In this paper, we view the task as a correlation-guided text representation problem: an attention-based two-step framework is proposed to integrate text information and label semantics by jointly learning words and labels in the same space. In this way, we aim to capture high-order label-label correlations as well as context-label correlations. Specifically, the proposed approach works by learning token-level representations of words and labels globally through a multi-layer Transformer and constructing an attention vector through word-label correlation matrix to generate the text representation. It ensures that relevant words receive higher weights than irrelevant words and thus directly optimizes the classification performance.  Extensive experiments over benchmark multi-label datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and further analysis demonstrates that it is competitive in both predicting low-frequency labels and convergence speed."
14,Automatic Mixed-Precision Quantization Search of BERT,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/472,"Pre-trained language models such as BERT have shown remarkable effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. However, these models usually contain millions of parameters, which prevent them from the practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge distillation, Weight pruning, and Quantization are known to be the main directions in  model compression. However, compact models obtained through knowledge distillation  may suffer from significant accuracy drop even for a relatively small compression ratio. On the other hand, there are only a few attempts based on quantization designed for natural language processing tasks, and they usually require manual setting on hyper-parameters. In this paper, we proposed an automatic mixed-precision quantization framework designed for BERT that can conduct quantization and pruning simultaneously. Specifically, our proposed method leverages Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to assign scale and precision for parameters in each sub-group automatically, and at the same pruning out redundant groups of parameters. Extensive evaluations on BERT downstream tasks reveal that our proposed method beats baselines by providing the same performance with much smaller model size. We also show the possibility of obtaining the extremely light-weight model by combining our solution with orthogonal methods such as DistilBERT."
15,Solving Math Word Problems with Teacher Supervision,Main,['Question Answering'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/485,"Math word problems (MWPs) have been recently addressed with Seq2Seq models by `translating' math problems described in natural language to a mathematical expression, following a typical encoder-decoder structure. Although effective in solving classical math problems, these models fail when a subtle variation is applied to the word expression of a math problem, and leads to a remarkably different answer. We find the failure is because MWPs with different answers but similar math formula expression are encoded closely in the latent space. We thus designed a teacher module to make the MWP encoding vector match the correct solution and disaccord from the wrong solutions, which are manipulated from the correct solution. Experimental results on two benchmark MWPs datasets verified that our proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art models."
16,TEC: A Time Evolving Contextual Graph Model for Speaker State Analysis in Political Debates,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/489,"Political discourses provide a forum for representatives to express their opinions and contribute towards policy making.  Analyzing these discussions is crucial for recognizing possible delegates and making better voting choices in an independent nation.  A politician's vote on a proposition is usually associated with their past discourses and impacted by cohesion forces in political parties. We focus on predicting a speaker's vote on a bill by augmenting linguistic models with temporal and cohesion contexts. We propose TEC, a time evolving graph based model that jointly employs links between motions, speakers, and temporal politician states.  TEC outperforms competitive models, illustrating the benefit of temporal and contextual signals for predicting a politician's stance."
17,Adaptive Residue-wise Profile Fusion for Low Homologous Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using External Knowledge,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/490,"Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is essential for protein function analysis. However, for low homologous proteins, the PSSP suffers from insufficient input features. In this paper, we explicitly import external self-supervised knowledge for low homologous PSSP under the guidance of residue-wise (amino acid wise) profile fusion. In practice, we firstly demonstrate the superiority of profile over Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) for low homologous PSSP. Based on this observation, we introduce the novel self-supervised BERT features as the pseudo profile, which implicitly involves the residue distribution in all native discovered sequences as the complementary features. Furthermore, a novel residue-wise attention is specially designed to adaptively fuse different features (i.e., original low-quality profile, BERT based pseudo profile), which not only takes full advantage of each feature but also avoids noise disturbance. Besides, the feature consistency loss is proposed to accelerate the model learning from multiple semantic levels. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts (i.e., 4.7% for extremely low homologous cases on BC40 dataset)."
18,A Novel Sequence-to-Subgraph Framework for Diagnosis Classification,Main,['NLP Applications and Tools'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/496,"Text-based diagnosis classification is a critical problem in AI-enabled healthcare studies, which assists clinicians in making correct decision and lowering the rate of diagnostic errors. Previous studies follow the routine of sequence based deep learning models in NLP literature to deal with clinical notes. However, recent studies find that structural information is important in clinical contents that greatly impacts the predictions. In this paper, a novel sequence-to-subgraph framework is introduced to process clinical texts for classification, which changes the paradigm of managing texts. Moreover, a new classification model under the framework is proposed that incorporates subgraph convolutional network and hierarchical diagnostic attentive network to extract the layered structural features of clinical texts. The evaluation conducted on both the real-world English and Chinese datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning based diagnosis classification models."
19,"Exemplification Modeling: Can You Give Me an Example, Please?",Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/520,"Recently, generative approaches have been used effectively to provide definitions of words in their context. However, the opposite, i.e., generating a usage example given one or more words along with their definitions, has not yet been investigated. In this work, we introduce the novel task of Exemplification Modeling (ExMod), along with a sequence-to-sequence architecture and a training procedure for it. Starting from a set of (word, definition) pairs, our approach is capable of automatically generating high-quality sentences which express the requested semantics. As a result, we can drive the creation of sense-tagged data which cover the full range of meanings in any inventory of interest, and their interactions within sentences. Human annotators agree that the sentences generated are as fluent and semantically-coherent with the input definitions as the sentences in manually-annotated corpora. Indeed, when employed as training data for Word Sense Disambiguation, our examples enable the current state of the art to be outperformed, and higher results to be achieved than when using gold-standard datasets only. We release the pretrained model, the dataset and the software at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/exmod."
20,Generating Senses and RoLes: An End-to-End Model for Dependency- and Span-based Semantic Role Labeling,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Generation', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/521,"Despite the recent great success of the sequence-to-sequence paradigm in Natural Language Processing, the majority of current studies in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) still frame the problem as a sequence labeling task. In this paper we go against the flow and propose GSRL (Generating Senses and RoLes), the first sequence-to-sequence model for end-to-end SRL. Our approach benefits from recently-proposed decoder-side pretraining techniques to generate both sense and role labels for all the predicates in an input sentence at once, in an end-to-end fashion. Evaluated on standard gold benchmarks, GSRL achieves state-of-the-art results in both dependency- and span-based English SRL, proving empirically that our simple generation-based model can learn to produce complex predicate-argument structures. Finally, we propose a framework for evaluating the robustness of an SRL model in a variety of synthetic low-resource scenarios which can aid human annotators in the creation of better, more diverse, and more challenging gold datasets. We release GSRL at github.com/SapienzaNLP/gsrl."
21,Improving Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation with Source-side Monolingual Documents,Main,['Machine Translation'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/522,"Document context-aware machine translation remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale document parallel corpora. To make full use of source-side monolingual documents for context-aware NMT, we propose a Pre-training approach with Global Context (PGC). In particular, we first propose a novel self-supervised pre-training task, which contains two training objectives: (1) reconstructing the original sentence from a corrupted version; (2) generating a gap sentence from its left and right neighbouring sentences. Then we design a universal model for PGC which consists of a global context encoder, a sentence encoder and a decoder, with similar architecture to typical context-aware NMT models. We evaluate the effectiveness and generality of our pre-trained PGC model by adapting it to various downstream context-aware NMT models. Detailed experimentation on four different translation tasks demonstrates that our PGC approach significantly improves the translation performance of context-aware NMT. For example, based on the state-of-the-art SAN model, we achieve an averaged improvement of 1.85 BLEU scores and 1.59 Meteor scores on the four translation tasks."
22,Focus on Interaction: A Novel Dynamic Graph Model for Joint Multiple Intent Detection and Slot Filling,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/523,"Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks for building a spoken language understanding (SLU) system. Since the two tasks are closely related, the joint models for the two tasks always outperform the pipeline models in SLU. However, most joint models directly incorporate multiple intent information for each token, which introduces intent noise into the sentence semantics, causing a decrease in the performance of the joint model. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Model (DGM) for joint multiple intent detection and slot filling, in which we adopt a sentence-level intent-slot interactive graph to model the correlation between the intents and slot. Besides, we design a novel method of constructing the graph, which can dynamically update the interactive graph and further alleviate the error propagation. Experimental results on several multi-intent and single-intent datasets show that our model not only achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance but also boosts the speed by three to six times over the SOTA model."
23,Dialogue Discourse-Aware Graph Model and Data Augmentation for Meeting Summarization,Main,"['Natural Language Summarization', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/524,"Meeting summarization is a challenging task due to its dynamic interaction nature among multiple speakers and lack of sufficient training data. Existing methods view the meeting as a linear sequence of utterances while ignoring the diverse relations between each utterance. Besides, the limited labeled data further hinders the ability of data-hungry neural models. In this paper, we try to mitigate the above challenges by introducing dialogue-discourse relations. First, we present a Dialogue Discourse-Dware Meeting Summarizer (DDAMS) to explicitly model the interaction between utterances in a meeting by modeling different discourse relations. The core module is a relational graph encoder, where the utterances and discourse relations are modeled in a graph interaction manner. Moreover, we devise a Dialogue Discourse-Aware Data Augmentation (DDADA) strategy to construct a pseudo-summarization corpus from existing input meetings, which is 20 times larger than the original dataset and can be used to pretrain DDAMS. Experimental results on AMI and ICSI meeting datasets show that our full system can achieve SOTA performance. Our codes and outputs are available at https://github.com/xcfcode/DDAMS/."

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for paraphrase generation. It simultaneously decodes the output sentence using a pretrained wordset-to-sequence model and a round-trip translation model. We evaluate this framework on Quora, WikiAnswers, MSCOCO and Twitter, and show its advantage over previous state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and distantly-supervised methods by significant margins on all datasets. For Quora and WikiAnswers, our framework even performs better than some strongly supervised methods with domain adaptation. Further, we show that the generated paraphrases can be used to augment the training data for machine translation to achieve substantial improvements."
25,Dialogue Disentanglement in Software Engineering: How Far are We?,Main,"['Dialogue', 'NLP Applications and Tools', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/526,"Despite the valuable information contained in software chat messages, disentangling them into distinct conversations is an essential prerequisite for any in-depth analyses that utilize this information. To provide a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate five popular dialog disentanglement approaches on software-related chat. We find that existing approaches do not perform well on disentangling software-related dialogs that discuss technical and complex topics. Further investigation on how well the existing disentanglement measures reflect human satisfaction shows that existing measures cannot correctly indicate human satisfaction on disentanglement results. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novel measure, named DLD. Using results of human satisfaction, we further summarize four most frequently appeared bad disentanglement cases on software-related chat to insight future improvements. These cases include (i) Ignoring Interaction Patterns, (ii) Ignoring Contextual Information, (iii) Mixing up Topics, and (iv) Ignoring User Relationships. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights on the effectiveness of existing dialog disentanglement approaches and these findings would promote a better application of dialog disentanglement in software engineering."
26,FedSpeech: Federated Text-to-Speech with Continual Learning,Main,['Speech'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/527,"Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models under strict privacy restrictions and federated text-to-speech aims to synthesize natural speech of multiple users with a few audio training samples stored in their devices locally. However, federated text-to-speech faces several challenges: very few training samples from each speaker are available, training samples are all stored in local device of each user, and global model is vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning architecture based on continual learning approaches to overcome the difficulties above. Specifically, 1) we use gradual pruning masks to isolate parameters for preserving speakers' tones; 2) we apply selective masks for effectively reusing knowledge from tasks; 3) a private speaker embedding is introduced to keep users' privacy. Experiments on a reduced VCTK dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSpeech: it nearly matches multi-task training in terms of multi-speaker speech quality; moreover, it sufficiently retains the speakers' tones and even outperforms the multi-task training in the speaker similarity experiment."
27,ALaSca: an Automated approach for Large-Scale Lexical Substitution,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/528,"The lexical substitution task aims at finding suitable replacements for words in context. It has proved to be useful in several areas, such as word sense induction and text simplification, as well as in more practical applications such as writing-assistant tools.  However, the paucity of annotated data has forced researchers to apply mainly unsupervised approaches,  limiting the applicability of large pre-trained models and thus hampering the potential benefits of supervised approaches to the task. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by proposing ALaSca, a novel approach to automatically creating large-scale datasets for  English lexical substitution.  ALaSca allows examples to be produced for potentially any word in a language vocabulary and to cover most of the meanings it lists.  Thanks to this,  we can unleash the full potential of neural architectures and finetune them on the lexical substitution task. Indeed,  when using our data, a  transformer-based model performs substantially better than when using manually annotated data only. We release  ALaSca at  https://sapienzanlp.github.io/alasca/."
28,Enhancing Label Representations with Relational Inductive Bias Constraint for Fine-Grained Entity Typing,Main,"['Named Entities', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/529,"Fine-Grained Entity Typing (FGET) is a task that aims at classifying an entity mention into a wide range of entity label types. Recent researches improve the task performance by imposing the label-relational inductive bias based on the hierarchy of labels or label co-occurrence graph. However, they usually overlook explicit interactions between instances and labels which may limit the capability of label representations. Therefore, we propose a novel method based on a two-phase graph network for the FGET task to enhance the label representations, via imposing the relational inductive biases of instance-to-label and label-to-label. In the phase 1, instance features will be introduced into label representations to make the label representations more representative. In the phase 2, interactions of labels will capture dependency relationships among them thus make label representations more smooth. During prediction, we introduce a pseudo-label generator for the construction of the two-phase graph. The input instances differ from batch to batch so that the label representations are dynamic. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness and stability of our proposed method and achieve state-of-the-art results on their testing sets."
29,Modelling General Properties of Nouns by Selectively Averaging Contextualised Embeddings,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/530,"While the success of pre-trained language models has largely eliminated the need for high-quality static word vectors in many NLP applications, static word vectors continue to play an important role in tasks where word meaning needs to be modelled in the absence of linguistic context. In this paper, we explore how the contextualised embeddings predicted by BERT can be used to produce high-quality word vectors for such domains, in particular related to knowledge base completion, where our focus is on capturing the semantic properties of nouns. We find that a simple strategy of averaging the contextualised embeddings of masked word mentions leads to vectors that outperform the static word vectors learned by BERT, as well as those from standard word embedding models, in property induction tasks. We notice in particular that masking target words is critical to achieve this strong performance, as the resulting vectors focus less on idiosyncratic properties and more on general semantic properties. Inspired by this view, we propose a filtering strategy which is aimed at removing the most idiosyncratic mention vectors, allowing us to obtain further performance gains in property induction."
30,Asynchronous Multi-grained Graph Network For Interpretable Multi-hop Reading Comprehension,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/531,"Multi-hop machine reading comprehension (MRC) task aims to enable models to answer the compound question according to the bridging information. Existing methods that use graph neural networks to represent multiple granularities such as entities and sentences in documents update all nodes synchronously, ignoring the fact that multi-hop reasoning has a certain logical order across granular levels. In this paper, we introduce an Asynchronous Multi-grained Graph Network (AMGN) for multi-hop MRC. First, we construct a multigrained graph containing entity and sentence nodes. Particularly, we use independent parameters to represent relationship groups defined according to the level of granularity. Second, an asynchronous update mechanism based on multi-grained relationships is proposed to mimic human multi-hop reading logic. Besides, we present a question reformulation mechanism to update the latent representation of the compound question with updated graph nodes. We evaluate the proposed model on the HotpotQA dataset and achieve top competitive performance in distractor setting compared with other published models. Further analysis shows that the asynchronous update mechanism can effectively form interpretable reasoning chains at different granularity levels."
31,Keep the Structure: A Latent Shift-Reduce Parser for Semantic Parsing,Main,['Natural Language Semantics'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/532,"Traditional end-to-end semantic parsing models treat a natural language utterance as a holonomic structure. However, hierarchical structures exist in natural languages, which also align with the hierarchical structures of logical forms. In this paper, we propose a latent shift-reduce parser, called LASP, which decomposes both natural language queries and logical form expressions according to their hierarchical structures and finds local alignment between them to enhance semantic parsing. LASP consists of a base parser and a shift-reduce splitter. The splitter dynamically separates an NL query into several spans. The base parser converts the relevant simple spans into logical forms, which are further combined to obtain the final logical form. We conducted empirical studies on two datasets across different domains and different types of logical forms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of semantic parsing, especially on unseen scenarios."
32,Discourse-Level Event Temporal Ordering with Uncertainty-Guided Graph Completion,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Processing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/533,"Learning to order events at discourse-level is a crucial text understanding task. Despite many efforts for this task, the current state-of-the-art methods rely heavily on manually designed features, which are costly to produce and are often specific to tasks/domains/datasets. In this paper, we propose a new graph perspective on the task, which does not require complex feature engineering but can assimilate global features and learn inter-dependencies effectively. Specifically, in our approach, each document is considered as a temporal graph, in which the nodes and edges represent events and event-event relations respectively. In this sense, the temporal ordering task corresponds to constructing edges for an empty graph. To train our model, we design a graph mask pre-training mechanism, which can learn inter-dependencies of temporal relations by learning to recover a masked edge following graph topology. In the testing stage, we design an certain-first strategy based on model uncertainty, which can decide the prediction orders and reduce the risk of error propagation. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods consistently and can meanwhile maintain good global consistency."
33,Improving Text Generation with Dynamic Masking and Recovering,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/534,"Due to different types of inputs, diverse text generation tasks may adopt different encoder-decoder frameworks. Thus most existing approaches that aim to improve the robustness of certain generation tasks are input-relevant, and may not work well for other generation tasks. Alternatively, in this paper we present a universal approach to enhance the language representation for text generation on the base of generic encoder-decoder frameworks. This is done from two levels. First, we introduce randomness by randomly masking some percentage of tokens on the decoder side when training the models. In this way, instead of using ground truth history context, we use its corrupted version to predict the next token. Then we propose an auxiliary task to properly recover those masked tokens. Experimental results on several text generation tasks including machine translation (MT), AMR-to-text generation, and image captioning show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over competitive baselines without using any task-specific techniques. This suggests the effectiveness and generality of our proposed approach."
34,Consistent Inference for Dialogue Relation Extraction,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Dialogue']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/535,"Relation Extraction is key to many downstream tasks. Dialogue relation extraction aims at discovering entity relations from multi-turn dialogue scenario. There exist utterance, topic and relation discrepancy mainly due to multi-speakers, utterances, and relations. In this paper, we propose a consistent learning and inference method to minimize possible contradictions from those distinctions. First, we design mask mechanisms to refine utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations respectively from the global dialogue representation for the utterance distinction. Then a gate mechanism is proposed to aggregate such bi-grained representations. Next, mutual attention mechanism is introduced to obtain the entity representation for various relation specific topic structures. Finally, the relational inference is performed through first order logic constraints over the labeled data to decrease logically contradictory predicted relations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the F1 performance improvement of the proposed method is at least 3.3% compared with SOTA."
35,Multi-Hop Fact Checking of Political Claims,Main,"['NLP Applications and Tools', 'Resources and Evaluation', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/536,"Recent work has proposed multi-hop models and datasets for studying complex natural language reasoning. One notable task requiring multi-hop reasoning is fact checking, where a set of connected evidence pieces leads to the final verdict of a claim. However, existing datasets either do not provide annotations for gold evidence pages, or the only dataset which does (FEVER) mostly consists of claims which can be fact-checked with simple reasoning and is constructed artificially. Here, we study more complex claim verification of naturally occurring claims with multiple hops over interconnected evidence chunks. We: 1) construct a small annotated dataset, PolitiHop, of evidence sentences for claim verification; 2) compare it to existing multi-hop datasets; and 3) study how to transfer knowledge from more extensive in- and out-of-domain resources to PolitiHop. We find that the task is complex and achieve the best performance with an architecture that specifically models reasoning over evidence pieces in combination with in-domain transfer learning."
36,Laughing Heads: Can Transformers Detect What Makes a Sentence Funny?,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/537,"The automatic detection of humor poses a grand challenge for natural language processing. Transformer-based systems have recently achieved remarkable results on this task, but they usually (1) were evaluated in setups where serious vs humorous texts came from entirely different sources, and (2) focused on benchmarking performance without providing insights into how the models work. We make progress in both respects by training and analyzing transformer-based humor recognition models on a recently introduced dataset consisting of minimal pairs of aligned sentences, one serious, the other humorous. We find that, although our aligned dataset is much harder than previous datasets, transformer-based models recognize the humorous sentence in an aligned pair with high accuracy (78\%). In a careful error analysis, we characterize easy vs hard instances. Finally, by analyzing attention weights, we obtain important insights into the mechanisms by which transformers recognize humor. Most remarkably, we find clear evidence that one single attention head learns to recognize the words that make a test sentence humorous, even without access to this information at training time."
37,A Streaming End-to-End Framework For Spoken Language Understanding,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Speech']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/538,"End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) recently attracted increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the new approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals, resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is typically designed to process one intent at a time, which leads users to have to take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and  multiple intentions will be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the detection accuracy is about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an online and incremental way. We also employ our model to an keyword spotting task using the Google Speech Commands dataset, and the results are also highly promising."
38,MultiMirror: Neural Cross-lingual Word Alignment for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation,Main,"['Natural Language Semantics', 'Resources and Evaluation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/539,"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), i.e., the task of assigning senses to words in context, has seen a surge of interest with the advent of neural models and a considerable increase in performance up to 80% F1 in English. However, when considering other languages, the availability of training data is limited, which hampers scaling WSD to many languages. To address this issue, we put forward MultiMirror, a sense projection approach for multilingual WSD based on a novel neural discriminative model for word alignment: given as input a pair of parallel sentences, our model -- trained with a low number of instances -- is capable of jointly aligning, at the same time, all source and target tokens with each other, surpassing its competitors across several language combinations. We demonstrate that projecting senses from English by leveraging the alignments produced by our model leads a simple mBERT-powered classifier to achieve a new state of the art on established WSD datasets in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese. We release our software and all our datasets at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/multimirror."
39,Learning Class-Transductive Intent Representations for Zero-shot Intent Detection,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/540,"Zero-shot intent detection (ZSID) aims to deal with the continuously emerging intents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer from two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between seen and unseen intents. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents under the generalized intent detection (GZSID) setting. A critical problem behind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot be learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent Representations (CTIR). Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen intents during training, with the corresponding label names serving as input utterances. On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which encourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity scorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is easy to implement and can be integrated with existing ZSID and GZSID methods. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the baseline systems."
40,MEDA: Meta-Learning with Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Text Classification,Main,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/541,"Meta-learning has recently emerged as a promising technique to address the challenge of few-shot learning. However, standard meta-learning methods mainly focus on visual tasks, which makes it hard for them to deal with diverse text data directly. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for few-shot text classification, which is named as MEta-learning with Data Augmentation (MEDA). MEDA is composed of two modules, a ball generator and a meta-learner, which are learned jointly. The ball generator is to increase the number of shots per class by generating more samples, so that meta-learner can be trained with both original and augmented samples. It is worth noting that ball generator is agnostic to the choice of the meta-learning methods. Experiment results show that on both datasets, MEDA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the performance of meta-learning on few-shot text classification."
41,A Sequence-to-Set Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/542,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a widely studied task in natural language processing. Recently, a growing number of studies have focused on the nested NER. The span-based methods, considering the entity recognition as a span classification task, can deal with nested entities naturally. But they suffer from the huge search space and the lack of interactions between entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel sequence-to-set neural network for nested NER. Instead of specifying candidate spans in advance, we provide a fixed set of learnable vectors to learn the patterns of the valuable spans. We utilize a non-autoregressive decoder to predict the final set of entities in one pass, in which we are able to capture dependencies between entities. Compared with the sequence-to-sequence method, our model is more suitable for such unordered recognition task as it is insensitive to the label order. In addition, we utilize the loss function based on bipartite matching to compute the overall training loss. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art on three nested NER corpora: ACE 2004, ACE 2005 and KBP 2017. The code is available at https://github.com/zqtan1024/sequence-to-set."
42,A Structure Self-Aware Model for Discourse Parsing on Multi-Party Dialogues,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Discourse', 'Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/543,"Conversational discourse structures aim to describe how a dialogue is organized, thus they are helpful for dialogue understanding and response generation. This paper focuses on predicting discourse dependency structures for multi-party dialogues. Previous work adopts incremental methods that take the features from the already predicted discourse relations to help generate the next one. Although the inter-correlations among predictions considered, we find that the error propagation is also very serious and hurts the overall performance. To alleviate error propagation, we propose a Structure Self-Aware (SSA) model, which adopts a novel edge-centric Graph Neural Network (GNN) to update the information between each Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) pair layer by layer, so that expressive representations can be learned without historical predictions. In addition, we take auxiliary training signals (e.g. structure distillation) for better representation learning. Our model achieves the new state-of-the-art performances on two conversational discourse parsing benchmarks, largely outperforming the previous methods."
43,Hierarchical Modeling of Label Dependency and Label Noise in Fine-grained Entity Typing,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Named Entities', 'NLP Applications and Tools']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/544,"Fine-grained entity typing (FET) aims to annotate the entity mentions in a sentence with fine-grained type labels. It brings plentiful semantic information for many natural language processing tasks. Existing FET approaches apply hard attention to learn on the noisy labels, and ignore that those noises have structured hierarchical dependency. Despite their successes, these FET models are insufficient in modeling type hierarchy dependencies and handling label noises. In this paper, we directly tackle the structured noisy labels by combining a forward tree module and a backward tree module. Specifically, the forward tree formulates the informative walk that hierarchically represents the type distributions. The backward tree models the erroneous walk that learns the noise confusion matrix. Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
44,Learn from Syntax: Improving Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction with Rich Syntactic Knowledge,Main,"['Information Extraction', 'Natural Language Semantics', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/545,"In this paper, we propose to enhance the pair-wise aspect and opinion terms extraction (PAOTE) task by incorporating rich syntactic knowledge. We first build a syntax fusion encoder for encoding syntactic features, including a label-aware graph convolutional network (LAGCN) for modeling the dependency edges and labels, as well as the POS tags unifiedly, and a local-attention module encoding POS tags for better term boundary detection. During pairing, we then adopt Biaffine and Triaffine scoring for high-order aspect-opinion term pairing, in the meantime re-harnessing the syntax-enriched representations in LAGCN for syntactic-aware scoring. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines, meanwhile yielding explainable predictions with syntactic knowledge."

To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a novel infobox knowledge-aware dialogue generation approach, HITA-Graph, with three unique features. First, open-domain infobox tables that describe entities with relevant attributes are adopted as the knowledge source. An order-irrelevance Hierarchical Infobox Table Encoder is proposed to represent an infobox table at three levels of granularity. In addition, an Infobox-Dialogue Interaction Graph Network is built to effectively integrate the infobox context and the dialogue context into a unified infobox representation. Second, a Hierarchical Infobox Attribute Attention mechanism is developed to  access the encoded infobox knowledge at different levels of granularity. Last but not least, a Dynamic Mode Fusion strategy is designed to allow the Decoder to select a vocabulary word or copy a word from the given infobox/query. We extract infobox tables from Chinese Wikipedia and construct an infobox knowledge base. Extensive evaluation on an open-released Chinese corpus demonstrates the superior performance of our approach against several representative methods."
46,Improving Stylized Neural Machine Translation with Iterative Dual Knowledge Transfer,Main,"['Machine Translation', 'Natural Language Generation']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/547,"Stylized neural machine translation (NMT) aims to translate sentences of one style into sentences of another style, which is essential for the application of machine translation in a real-world scenario. However, a major challenge in this task is the scarcity of high-quality parallel data which is stylized paired. To address this problem, we propose an iterative dual knowledge transfer framework that utilizes informal training data of machine translation and formality style transfer data to create large-scale stylized paired data, for the training of stylized machine translation model. Specifically, we perform bidirectional knowledge transfer between translation model and text style transfer model iteratively through knowledge distillation. Then, we further propose a data-refinement module to process the noisy synthetic parallel data generated during knowledge transfer. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an improvement over the existing best model by 5 BLEU points on MTFC dataset. Meanwhile, extensive analyses illustrate our method can also improve the accuracy of formality style transfer."
47,UniMF: A Unified Framework to Incorporate Multimodal Knowledge Bases intoEnd-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,Main,"['Dialogue', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge Extraction']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/548,"Knowledge bases (KBs) are usually essential for building practical dialogue systems. Recently we have seen rapidly growing interest in integrating knowledge bases into dialogue systems. However, existing approaches mostly deal with knowledge bases of a single modality, typically textual information. As today's knowledge bases become abundant with multimodal information such as images, audios and videos, the limitation of existing approaches greatly hinders the development of dialogue systems. In this paper, we focus on task-oriented dialogue systems and address this limitation by proposing a novel model that integrates external multimodal KB reasoning with pre-trained language models. We further enhance the model via a novel multi-granularity fusion mechanism to capture multi-grained semantics in the dialogue history. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a new large-scale (14K) dialogue dataset MMDialKB, built upon multimodal KB. Both automatic and human evaluation results on MMDialKB demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over strong baselines."
48,MRD-Net: Multi-Modal Residual Knowledge Distillation for Spoken Question Answering,Main,"['Question Answering', 'Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining', 'Speech']",https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/549,"Spoken question answering (SQA) has recently drawn considerable attention in the speech community. It requires systems to find correct answers from the given spoken passages simultaneously. The common SQA systems consist of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) module and text-based question answering module. However, previous methods suffer from severe performance degradation due to ASR errors. To alleviate this problem, this work proposes a novel multi-modal residual knowledge distillation method (MRD-Net), which further distills knowledge at the acoustic level from the audio-assistant (Audio-A). Specifically, we utilize the teacher (T) trained on manual transcriptions to guide the training of the student (S) on ASR transcriptions. We also show that introducing an Audio-A helps this procedure by learning residual errors between T and S. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective attention mechanism to adaptively leverage audio-text features as the new deep attention knowledge to boost the network performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MRD-Net achieves superior results compared with state-of-the-art methods on three spoken question answering benchmark datasets."

Previous methods for slot filling usually adopt sequence labeling framework, which, however, often has limited ability when dealing with the domain-specific slots. In this paper, we take a new perspective on cross-domain slot filling by framing it as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem. Our approach firstly transforms slot names into well-designed queries, which contain rich informative prior knowledge and are very helpful for the detection of domain-specific slots. In addition, we utilize the large-scale MRC dataset for pre-training, which further alleviates the data scarcity problem. Experimental results on SNIPS and ATIS datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

Previously proposed graph-based or transformer-based models utilize the entities independently, regardless of global information among relational triples. This paper approaches the problem by predicting an entity-level relation matrix to capture local and global information, parallel to the semantic segmentation task in computer vision. Herein, we propose a Document U-shaped Network for document-level relation extraction. Specifically, we leverage an encoder module to capture the context information of entities and a U-shaped segmentation module over the image-style feature map to capture global interdependency among triples. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets DocRED, CDR, and GDA."

However, traditional methods neglect the fact that redundant and irrelevant knowledge exists in external knowledge bases. In this study, we launched an in-depth empirical investigation into downstream tasks and found that knowledge-enhanced approaches do not always exhibit satisfactory improvements. To this end, we investigate the fundamental reasons for ineffective knowledge infusion and present selective injection for language pretraining, which constitutes a model-agnostic method and is readily pluggable into previous approaches.

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it."

Most existing research models this as a classification task with a single intent label per utterance. Going beyond this formulation, we define and investigate a new problem of open intent discovery. It involves discovering one or more generic intent types from text utterances, that may not have been encountered during training. We propose a novel, domain-agnostic approach, OPINE, which formulates the problem as a sequence tagging task in an open-world setting. It employs a CRF on top of a bidirectional LSTM to extract intents in a consistent format, subject to constraints among intent tag labels. We apply multi-headed self-attention and adversarial training to effectively learn dependencies between distant words, and robustly adapt our model across varying domains. We also curate and release an intent-annotated dataset of 25K real-life utterances spanning diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that OPINE outperforms state-of-art baselines by 5-15% F1 score."
56,Towards Robust Dynamic Network Embedding,Doctoral Consortium,['Embeddings'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/676,"Dynamic Network Embedding (DNE) has recently drawn much attention due to the dynamic nature of many real-world networks. Comparing to a static network, a dynamic network has a unique character called the degree of changes, which can be defined as the average number of the changed edges between consecutive snapshots spanning a dynamic network. The degree of changes could be quite different even for the dynamic networks generated from the same dataset. It is natural to ask whether existing DNE methods are effective and robust w.r.t. the degree of changes. Towards robust DNE, we suggest two important scenarios. One is to investigate the robustness w.r.t. different slicing settings that are used to generate different dynamic networks with different degree of changes, while another focuses more on the robustness w.r.t. different number of changed edges over timesteps."

63,Graph-Augmented Code Summarization in Computational Notebooks,Demo,['General'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/717,"Computational notebooks allow data scientists to express their ideas through a combination of code and documentation. However, data scientists often pay attention only to the code and neglect the creation of the documentation in a notebook. In this work, we present a human-centered automation system, Themisto, that can support users to easily create documentation via three approaches: 1) We have developed and reported a GNN-augmented code documentation generation algorithm in a previous paper, which can generate documentation for a given source code; 2) Themisto also implements a query-based approach to retrieve the online API documentation as the summary for certain types of source code; 3) Lastly, Themistoalso enables a user prompt approach to motivate users to write documentation for some use cases that automation does not work well."
64,IIAS: An Intelligent Insurance Assessment System through Online Real-time Conversation Analysis,Demo,['General'],https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/721,"With the development of Chinese medical insurance industry, the amount of claim cases is growing rapidly. Ultimately, more claims necessarily indicate that the insurance company has to spend much time assessing claims and decides how much compensation the claimant should receive, which is a highly professional process that involves many complex operations. Therefore, the insurance assessor's role is essential. However, for the junior assessor often lacking in practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such an online procedure. In order to alleviate assessors' cognitive workload, we propose an Intelligent Insurance Assessment System (IIAS) that helps effectively collect claimant information through online real-time conversation analysis. With the assistance of IIAS, the average time cost of the insurance assessment procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes."
